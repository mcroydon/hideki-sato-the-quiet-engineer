# Chapter 13: Reckoning

*Facing failure*

---

There is a particular silence that descends on an engineering floor when the numbers come in and the numbers are bad.

Not the silence of concentration — that has its own quality, a hum of focus, the quiet percussion of fingers on keyboards and the low murmur of colleagues working through problems together. This is different. This is the silence of people who have seen the future and understand, with the awful clarity that data provides, that the thing they have built is not going to win. That the thousands of hours, the arguments over processor architectures, the late nights debugging assembly code, the small triumphs of getting a sprite to render correctly or a bus conflict resolved — all of it is being weighed on a scale, and the scale is tipping the wrong way.

By late 1997, this silence had settled over Sega like weather.

## The Weight of Numbers

The Saturn was not supposed to fail. No console ever is, of course — no company builds hardware expecting to lose — but the Saturn carried heavier expectations than most. It was Sega's answer to the thirty-two-bit era, the successor to the Genesis, the machine that was meant to prove that Sega's dominance in the sixteen-bit generation was not a fluke but the beginning of a dynasty. Hideki Sato had poured everything he knew into its design — the ambitious architecture whose complexities and compromises we have already traced in detail.[^1]

Instead, the Saturn had become an object lesson in how a technically ambitious machine could be defeated by forces that had nothing to do with the quality of its silicon.

The sales figures told the story with brutal efficiency. Worldwide, the Saturn moved approximately 9.26 million units — respectable in isolation, but catastrophic in context.[^2] Sony's PlayStation, which had launched within weeks of the Saturn, was on its way to selling over 102 million.[^3] Even Nintendo's cartridge-based N64, which arrived two years late and carried its own set of liabilities, would outsell the Saturn by a factor of nearly four to one.[^4] In the United States, where the sixteen-bit Genesis had once commanded 65 percent market share, the Saturn had limped to approximately 1.8 million units — a rounding error in a market that Sony was consuming whole.[^5]

The financial toll was devastating. Each Saturn unit sold generated a loss of approximately 10,000 yen — roughly $100 at mid-1990s exchange rates — because Sega had been forced to price the console below its manufacturing cost to compete with the PlayStation's aggressive $299 price point.[^6] When software sales could not offset the hardware losses, Sega had deliberately constrained production, creating a vicious cycle: fewer consoles meant fewer game sales, which meant less revenue to offset the losses, which meant less justification for building more consoles.[^7]

In the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega posted its first consolidated financial loss since listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1988 — a net loss of 35.6 billion yen, approximately $270 million.[^8] Consumer product sales had declined by 54.8 percent, with overseas sales collapsing by 75.4 percent.[^9] The company that had once generated revenues of 354 billion yen — its peak in fiscal year 1994, the glory days of the Genesis — was now watching its business implode.[^10]

And the decline had not started with the Saturn. That was perhaps the most disorienting part. When Sato and his colleagues traced the financial trajectory back through the data, they found that the rot had begun earlier than anyone had realized — in late 1993, while the Genesis was still the market leader in North America, before the Saturn had shipped a single unit.[^11] In the second half of fiscal year 1994, consumer export revenue had dropped to just 62 percent of the first half — a collapse that occurred during what should have been the most profitable holiday season.[^12] The yen's relentless appreciation against the dollar — from 127 yen per dollar in 1992 to 111 in 1993 to 102 in 1994 to just 94 in 1995 — had been silently eroding the profitability of every unit Sega shipped overseas.[^13] North American retailers had exploited return policies to devastating effect, sending back unsold inventory and wiping out Sega of America's reported profits with extraordinary losses of one to two hundred million dollars on returned stock.[^14]

The Saturn had not caused Sega's crisis. It had inherited one.

## A Cascade of Wounds

But if the Saturn did not start the bleeding, it had done nothing to stop it. The machine's problems were legion, and they compounded each other with the remorseless logic of a system failure.

Start with the surprise launch — the catastrophe at E3 that has already been recounted in full.[^15] The alienated retailers, the six-game library, the hundred-dollar price gap with the PlayStation — each of these wounds, inflicted in a single week in May 1995, had compounded into a cascade of institutional damage.[^16] Within two days of the PlayStation's own North American launch in September, Sony had sold more units than the Saturn had managed in five months.[^17]

Then there was the architecture itself — the dual-CPU complexity, the inadequate development tools, the eight-processor labyrinth that had made the Saturn the most difficult console of its generation to program.[^20] These problems, examined at length in earlier chapters, had a cumulative financial consequence: they drove developers to the PlayStation, thinning the Saturn's software library, which in turn suppressed hardware sales, which in turn deepened the per-unit losses. Every technical difficulty translated, eventually, into a line item on a balance sheet.[^21]

And underneath it all was the strategic fragmentation that had preceded the Saturn entirely — the Sega CD, the 32X, the bewildering array of add-ons and peripherals that had fractured Sega's installed base, exhausted consumer goodwill, and taught a generation of players that buying a Sega product meant committing to a platform that might be abandoned within months.[^25] By the time the Saturn arrived, Sega had already spent its credibility.

## The Man from Honda

In January 1998, Hayao Nakayama was removed as president of Sega.[^26]

Nakayama had been the man who had pushed Sega into the console business in the first place — the jukebox repairman turned CEO who had seen the arcade downturn of the early 1980s as a reason to diversify into home hardware. Under his leadership, Sega had launched every console from the SG-1000 through the Saturn, had battled Nintendo to a near-draw in the sixteen-bit generation, and had built a company that at its peak generated more than three billion dollars in annual revenue. But the Saturn's failure was his failure, the surprise launch had been his mandate, and the financial irregularities that Okawa had uncovered — the billions in loans flowing to overseas subsidiaries — had happened on his watch. The official announcement framed it as a resignation. No one mistook it for anything else.[^26a]

His replacement was an outsider — and a deliberate one.

Shoichiro Irimajiri had come to Sega in 1996, initially as chairman and CEO of Sega of America.[^27] His background was not in video games or consumer electronics but in automobiles: he was a former executive at Honda Motor Company, where he had built a reputation as a rigorous operational manager with a talent for turning around struggling divisions. Irimajiri had no sentimental attachment to Sega's hardware heritage, no loyalty to the specific architectural choices that had produced the Saturn, no stake in the internal debates that had consumed the company for years. He was, in the most literal sense, a fresh pair of eyes.

When Irimajiri assumed the presidency of Sega Enterprises in January 1998, he inherited a company in crisis — but also a company that still possessed extraordinary assets.[^28] Sega's arcade division remained a world leader, producing hardware and software that generated steady revenue and, more importantly, maintained the engineering excellence that had always been the company's core competence. The Genesis, even in decline, had built an installed base of over thirty million units worldwide and a brand recognition that still resonated with consumers.[^29] And the company's R&D teams — Sato's teams — still contained some of the most talented hardware engineers in the Japanese electronics industry.

The question Irimajiri had to answer was the one that Sato, and every engineer on the hardware floor, had been turning over in their minds for months: Does Sega try again?

## The Question

It was not an abstract question. It was a question about identity, about purpose, about what Sega *was*.

There were compelling reasons to stop. The console hardware business had revealed itself to be a brutal winner-take-most competition in which the margins for error were vanishingly small and the costs of failure were existential. Sony had demonstrated that a deep-pocketed electronics conglomerate with superior manufacturing scale, ruthless pricing discipline, and an instinct for developer relations could simply overwhelm a smaller competitor. The PlayStation's success was not a fluke — it was a structural advantage, built on Sony's ability to subsidize hardware losses with profits from its broader electronics empire, to leverage its global brand and distribution network, and to attract third-party developers with a platform that was both powerful and easy to work with.

Sega had none of these advantages. It was a midsized Japanese entertainment company with a balance sheet that was deteriorating by the quarter, a brand that had been damaged by the Saturn's underperformance and the 32X debacle before it, and a relationship with third-party publishers that ranged from strained to nonexistent. Some of the most important developers in the industry — Electronic Arts, Square — had already signaled their disinterest in supporting Sega's platforms. The smart money, the rational calculation, said: stop making hardware. Become a software company. License your franchises. Let someone else take the manufacturing risk.

This was not just the view of outside analysts. It was the explicit recommendation of Sega's most formidable competitor. Kutaragi's entreaties at those dinners — "Hideki-chan, please give up!" — were not cruel. They were candid, rooted in the structural mathematics of Sony's vertical integration and Sega's dependency on suppliers.[^30] But for Sato, each dinner was a reminder that the man who had designed the machine destroying his own was telling him, with genuine warmth, that the thing he had spent his career doing was no longer worth doing.

## What Went Wrong

But before Sega could decide whether to try again, it had to understand why the Saturn had failed. And here Sato's assessment was clear-eyed to the point of being painful.

The Saturn's failure was not, fundamentally, a technical failure. The machine was powerful — the previous chapters have shown what it could do in the right hands.[^31] The problem was that the right hands were vanishingly rare, and Sega had made their work unnecessarily difficult.

The technical lessons — the architecture that should have been based on Model 1, the reactive dual-CPU pivot, the development tools that Sato himself admitted were "really just portions of application software" — have been examined.[^32] What mattered now, in the reckoning, was the cumulative weight. It was not any single failure but the interaction of failures: an architecture too complex for most developers, launched too early for its own ecosystem, priced too high against the competition, sold by a company at war with itself. The silicon worked. The architecture functioned. But the system — the business system, the organizational system, the ecosystem of developers and retailers and consumers — had collapsed.

The lessons were agonizing in their clarity. Developer accessibility mattered more than raw power. Reactive design produced compromised architectures. The arcade-to-home pipeline needed to be managed, not left to organizational happenstance. And the hardware was only part of the equation — perhaps the smallest part.[^33]

## Killing the Saturn

Stolar's kill order — "We have to kill the Saturn" — has been recounted in the previous chapters, along with its effect on Sato's engineering team.[^34] What belongs to this chapter is the financial reality that made the order inevitable, and the discovery that made it devastating.

The Saturn continued to sell in Japan, where it found a loyal audience of approximately 5.75 million — actually outselling the Genesis's 3.58 million in the Japanese market.[^35] But the American and European markets had been lost. Saturn production was wound down — in the United States and Europe by 1998, in Japan by 2000.[^36]

And then Okawa Isao, the chairman of CSK and Sega's controlling shareholder, began looking at the books.

What Okawa discovered was worse than anyone had imagined. Massive loans had been flowing to Sega's overseas subsidiaries — thirty-five billion yen to Sega of America, over twenty billion more to Europe. Under standalone accounting, the practice had been camouflaged: the lending appeared as assets on the parent company's balance sheet, and subsidiary purchases were booked as revenue. It was not fraud, exactly — it was the kind of creative accounting that metastasizes inside companies where divisions operate as fiefdoms and no one looks too closely at the transfers between them. When Okawa finally understood the full picture, he was furious.[^36a]

It was this discovery, as much as the Saturn's commercial failure, that precipitated the change at the top.

## The Emotional Physics of Failure

There is a particular kind of grief that engineers feel when a product they have built is discontinued. It is not the same as personal loss — no one has died, nothing irreplaceable has been destroyed. And yet the feeling is real, and it runs deep, because an engineer's relationship to their creation is intimate in ways that outsiders rarely appreciate.

Sato had lived inside the Saturn's architecture for years. He had chosen its processors, debated its bus configurations, fought for its design choices against skeptics both inside and outside the company. He had watched his team wrestle with the dual-CPU implementation, had seen them solve problems that seemed insoluble, had felt the satisfaction of a machine that worked — that genuinely worked, that could produce beautiful images and rich sounds and experiences that no other hardware could deliver in quite the same way.

And now that machine was being declared a failure. Not because it did not work — it worked — but because the world around it had moved in directions that its architecture could not follow, because decisions made above and around and sometimes in spite of the engineering team had placed it in a competitive position from which no amount of technical excellence could recover.

Sato was not a man given to public displays of emotion. The interviews he gave, the oral histories he recorded, the talks he delivered — all of them were characterized by a candor that was analytical rather than sentimental. He could discuss the Saturn's shortcomings with the clinical precision of an engineer reviewing a post-mortem, acknowledging the difficulty of the hardware, the inadequacy of the development tools, the mistake of not leveraging the Model 1 architecture. But underneath the analysis was something that the words alone could not convey: the experience of watching something you built be weighed and found wanting. Not in its engineering — in its fate.

## The Determination to Try Once More

And yet.

The Saturn's failure, for all its pain, did not extinguish the conviction — held by Sato, held by Irimajiri, held by enough people within Sega to tip the balance — that the company should build one more console.

The reasoning was partly strategic. Sega without hardware was Sega without its identity. The company had been a hardware maker from its founding — from the jukeboxes and slot machines of Service Games, through the electromechanical arcades and the custom-silicon consoles, hardware had been the spine of everything Sega did. Its arcade business depended on proprietary boards. Its game development studios designed for Sega hardware. Its brand was built on the distinctive look and feel of Sega machines — the black-and-gold Genesis, the grey Saturn, the unmistakable physical objects that sat under televisions in millions of homes. To abandon hardware was to abandon the thing that made Sega different from every other game publisher.

The reasoning was partly emotional. Engineers who have built something and watched it fail do not, as a rule, want their last word to be the failure. The impulse to try again — to take the lessons learned from the Saturn's shortcomings and apply them to something better, something cleaner, something that gets it right — is one of the most powerful forces in engineering culture. It is not stubbornness, exactly, though it can look like stubbornness from the outside. It is the conviction that the knowledge gained through failure is itself valuable, that the team that built the Saturn understood things about console design that no one else in the world understood, and that this understanding deserved another chance to express itself in silicon.

And the reasoning was partly competitive. Sony had proven that the console market was enormous — the PlayStation was selling in quantities that dwarfed anything the Genesis had achieved. A company that could capture even a modest share of that market would generate revenues sufficient to transform its fortunes. The prize was too large to walk away from, even for a company that had been badly burned.

Irimajiri, the Honda man, agreed. He laid out an ambitious plan: Sega would develop a new console, the most technically advanced machine the company had ever built, and it would use that console to restore its market position.[^39] The investment would be massive — $50 to $80 million in hardware development alone, with $150 to $200 million for software and $300 million for worldwide promotion.[^40] For a company that was posting billion-yen losses, it was a gamble of almost reckless proportions. But Irimajiri understood something about turnarounds that his background at Honda had taught him: sometimes the only way out of a crisis is through, and the cost of timidity is higher than the cost of boldness.

The new console would be codenamed Katana. It would eventually be called the Dreamcast.

But before Sato could build it, he had to fight for it.

## Two Designs

But the path from resolve to reality would not be straight. In 1997, something unprecedented happened within Sega: Irimajiri, the outsider president, decided that the team that had designed the Saturn could not be trusted to design whatever came next.[^41] He quietly commissioned a rival hardware group in the United States — American engineers working with American chips — to develop a competing architecture. The Father of Sega Hardware would have to win a competition for the right to build what might be Sega's last machine.

That competition, and the console it produced, would define the final chapter of Sato's engineering career.

## The Valley

In the winter of 1997-98, Sega occupied a strange and precarious position. The Saturn was dying. The Dreamcast was not yet born. The company was losing money, losing market share, and watching its competitors grow stronger by the quarter. Nakayama had stepped down. Irimajiri was installed but untested. Two competing hardware teams were racing toward the same goal through different paths. And the fundamental question — whether Sega could survive another console cycle, whether the market would give the company one more chance after the Saturn and the 32X and the Sega CD and the accumulated weight of half a decade's worth of missteps — remained unanswered.

For Sato, this was the valley. The lowest point of a career that had begun in 1971, when he had walked into Sega's R&D division as a twenty-year-old engineering graduate, full of the quiet confidence that comes from knowing you can build things that work. Twenty-six years later, he had risen to corporate senior vice president and deputy general manager of the consumer business.[^46] He had designed or overseen the design of every home console the company had ever produced. He had negotiated the deal that put the Motorola 68000 in the Genesis. He had chosen the Hitachi SH-2 for the Saturn and was now championing his own vision for the next machine against a rival team's competing design. He had watched his machines succeed and fail, had felt the elation of the Genesis years and the agony of the Saturn's decline.

Now he stood at the hinge point. Behind him was the wreckage of the thirty-two-bit generation — the financial losses, the strategic errors, the console that was too difficult to program and too expensive to sell. Ahead of him was one more chance: a new machine, a new architecture, built on the hard-won lessons of everything that had gone wrong.

Sato knew, with the certainty that only comes from having lived through failure, exactly what the Dreamcast needed to be. It needed to be simple where the Saturn had been complex. Accessible where the Saturn had been opaque. Forward-looking where the Saturn had been reactive. It needed to be a machine that developers could understand and exploit, that consumers could afford, that could compete not just on the basis of raw power but on the basis of *ideas* — new directions, new angles, new ways of thinking about what a console could do.

"With graphics and sounds, if you don't increase the power of a new console by a magnitude of times one hundred, the average user won't really notice the change," he had said. "That's why you have to find some new direction, some new angle, when you create a new console."[^47]

The new direction was already forming in his mind. It had a modem in it.
