# Chapter 1: The Ruins and the Radio

---

In the autumn of 1948, on the northern island of Hokkaido, a boy was born into a country that had ceased to exist.

Not literally, of course. Japan still appeared on maps. Its emperor still sat on the Chrysanthemum Throne, though his divinity had been formally renounced two years earlier in a written rescript that appeared on the front pages of every major newspaper, a declaration that most of his subjects could scarcely believe they were reading.[^1] The islands remained where they had always been, fringed by cold Pacific currents and shrouded in the volcanic mists that had given the archipelago its ancient name. But the Japan that Hideki Sato entered on November 5, 1948, bore almost no resemblance to the imperial power that had, just three years before, commanded an empire stretching from Manchuria to the Solomon Islands.[^2]

The major cities were ruins. American firebombing campaigns had incinerated sixty-seven urban centers, reducing Tokyo's wooden residential districts to miles of ash and blackened foundations.[^3] Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been struck by weapons so terrible that the language had not yet developed adequate words for their aftermath. Industrial infrastructure — the shipyards, the steel mills, the factories that had fueled the war machine — lay shattered. The population was hungry, displaced, and occupied by a foreign army whose supreme commander, General Douglas MacArthur, governed from the Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Building in central Tokyo with the authority of a modern shogun.[^4]

Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost major island, had been spared the worst of the bombing. Its cities were smaller, its landscape dominated by mountains and farmland and vast forests of birch and spruce that would have looked more at home in Scandinavia than in the popular imagination of Japan. But even in Hokkaido, the war's aftermath was inescapable. Soldiers were returning — those who returned at all — to families that had been reshaped by rationing, conscription, and loss. The economy was in free fall. Inflation was devouring savings at a pace that made yesterday's wages meaningless by tomorrow.[^5]

Into this world came a child who would, over the course of five decades, help build machines that brought joy to hundreds of millions of people. But that future was unimaginable in 1948. The country needed to learn how to feed itself first.

## The Ashes

The scale of Japan's devastation in 1945 defies casual summary. The firebombing of Tokyo on the night of March 9-10, 1945 — a single raid — killed an estimated one hundred thousand people, rivaling or exceeding the immediate death toll of either atomic bomb.[^6] Across the country, roughly 40 percent of the urban area of sixty-six cities had been destroyed.[^7] Nine million people were homeless. Agricultural production had fallen to levels that threatened mass starvation.[^8]

The occupation that followed was sweeping and strange. MacArthur's Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers — known universally by its acronym, SCAP — did not merely administer a conquered territory. It attempted to redesign Japanese society from the ground up. Land reform redistributed approximately 5.8 million acres from landlords to the tenant farmers who worked them, dismantling a feudal power structure that had persisted for centuries. By 1950, three million peasants had become landowners.[^9] The great *zaibatsu* — the sprawling industrial conglomerates like Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo that had dominated the Japanese economy since the Meiji era — were targeted for dissolution. Sixteen were marked for complete breakup, and twenty-six more for reorganization.[^10]

Women gained the right to vote. A new constitution, largely drafted by American lawyers working against an impossible deadline, renounced war as a sovereign right and established a parliamentary democracy.[^11] The education system was overhauled root and branch — a transformation that would prove especially consequential for a generation of future engineers.

But Cold War realities soon complicated the reformers' ambitions. As the Soviet Union consolidated power in Eastern Europe and Mao Zedong's forces swept across China, Washington's priorities shifted. Japan was no longer merely a defeated enemy to be reformed — it was a strategic bulwark against communism in Asia. The zaibatsu dissolutions were quietly walked back. Many of the conglomerates reconstituted themselves as *keiretsu* — looser, horizontally integrated networks of companies linked by cross-shareholdings and centered on a core bank, less rigidly hierarchical than their predecessors but no less powerful.[^12] By the 1960s, six major keiretsu groups had emerged: Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Sanwa, and Dai-Ichi Kangyo.[^13]

In 1949, the American banker Joseph Dodge arrived with a prescription for Japan's rampant inflation: monetary contraction, balanced budgets, an end to subsidies, and a fixed exchange rate of 360 yen to the dollar.[^14] The medicine was brutal. Japan plunged into a recession so severe it became known as the "Dodge squeeze," with mass layoffs and shuttered factories adding fresh misery to a population still clawing its way out of wartime deprivation.[^15]

What ended the recession was, ironically, another war. When North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel in June 1950, the United States suddenly needed a nearby industrial base to supply its military effort. Orders flooded into Japanese factories: ships, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, machine parts. Toyota, on the verge of bankruptcy, was saved by contracts for military trucks.[^16] Special procurement payments amounted to 27 percent of Japan's total export trade — $149 million in 1950, rising to $809 million by 1953.[^17] The index of industrial production surpassed its prewar peak for the first time in October 1950.[^18]

The Korean War boom was a blood transfusion for a dying patient. It was also something more: proof that Japanese industry could still compete, still produce, still build. The muscle memory of manufacturing had survived the firebombing. It simply needed orders to fill.

## The Sound of the Future

For a child growing up in Japan in the early 1950s, the most tangible evidence that the world was changing came not from economic statistics or government proclamations. It came from a small device you could hold in your hand.

The transistor had been invented at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey in December 1947, a feat of quantum physics and materials science that would eventually earn its creators the Nobel Prize.[^19] In the United States, it was understood primarily as a component — a replacement for the vacuum tube, smaller and more reliable, destined for use in telephone switching equipment and military electronics. But in Japan, a man named Masaru Ibuka saw something else entirely.

Ibuka was the co-founder of a small, ambitious Tokyo company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo — Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation — that would later rename itself Sony.[^20] In 1952, Ibuka traveled to the United States and learned that Western Electric was licensing Bell Labs' transistor patents. Most of the American companies acquiring licenses planned to use transistors in hearing aids or military equipment. Ibuka wanted to build a radio.[^21]

The idea struck many as absurd. Transistors at the time could handle only low frequencies, unsuitable for the full audio range that a radio required. Ibuka's company had fewer than five hundred employees and no experience with semiconductor fabrication. But he was convinced that transistors represented a technological revolution, and he was determined that his company would ride it.

He sent his partner, Akio Morita, to New York to sign the licensing deal in August 1953. The fee was $25,000 — a sum so large in foreign currency that Ibuka had to obtain special permission from the Ministry of Finance to make the payment.[^22] Back in Tokyo, Sony's engineers set to work solving the frequency problem, spending months developing germanium transistors capable of handling higher frequencies through innovative doping techniques and manufacturing processes.

In 1955, Sony released the TR-55 — Japan's first commercially produced transistor radio.[^23] It was roughly the size of a hardcover book, with five transistors designed and manufactured in-house. It used printed circuit boards, which was unusual for the era, and it worked. It really worked.

But the true breakthrough came two years later with the TR-63 — smaller, cheaper, portable enough to slip into a shirt pocket (or at least into a pocket that Sony's salesmen had been instructed to have specially tailored into their shirts for demonstrations).[^24] The TR-63 became Sony's first product sold in the United States, and it ignited a revolution. Suddenly, music was personal. A teenager could carry a radio to the beach, to school, to bed. Radio was no longer furniture — a hulking wooden cabinet in the family room. It was yours.

The transistor radio became the most popular electronic communication device of the 1960s, driven by the baby boom, the explosion of rock and roll, and the rise of disc jockeys on independent radio stations.[^25] Japanese companies raced to build them. Other firms had entered the transistor business even before Sony — Kobe Kogyo (later acquired by Fujitsu) had become the first company to manufacture and sell transistors in Japan, based on a technology assistance contract signed in June 1951, and NEC had begun transistor research and development in 1950.[^26] But Sony's radios captured the public imagination. "Made in Japan," a phrase that had been synonymous with cheap imitation, began its long transformation into a mark of ingenuity.

For a boy in Hokkaido — for any child in Japan — the transistor radio would have been a small miracle. Here was a device that collapsed distance, that brought the sounds of Tokyo and Osaka and the wider world into your hands. It was proof that the future would be built not from steel and concrete alone, but from silicon and solder and the invisible movement of electrons through crystalline lattices. The ruins were still visible in the early 1950s, but the radios were already singing.

## The Architect's Hand

Japan's postwar economic recovery is sometimes described as a "miracle," as though it arrived unbidden, a gift of providence or national character. The reality was more deliberate than that. Japan's transformation was engineered — not by any single individual, but by a web of institutions, policies, and strategic decisions that channeled the nation's energies toward specific industrial goals.

At the center of this web sat the Ministry of International Trade and Industry — MITI.[^27]

Established in 1949 and operating until 2001, MITI was perhaps the most powerful economic planning agency in the capitalist world. It did not own factories or dictate production quotas in the manner of a Soviet ministry. Instead, it operated through a more subtle and arguably more effective toolkit: directing investment, funding research, coordinating cooperation between rival firms, managing imports and exports, and sending clear signals to the banking system about which industries deserved cheap capital.[^28]

MITI's bureaucrats — recruited from the very top of Japan's university system, mostly Tokyo University graduates who had survived the most grueling entrance examinations in the country — identified target industries with methodical deliberation. In the 1950s, the priorities were heavy industry: steel, shipbuilding, chemicals. By the 1960s and into the 1970s, the focus shifted decisively toward electronics and semiconductors.[^29]

The ministry's interventions could be remarkably direct. It sent written instructions to Japan's major chip users telling them to buy Japanese. It coordinated banks to make cheap capital available for semiconductor investment. When the global semiconductor market began to coalesce in the 1970s, MITI orchestrated one of the most audacious public-private research initiatives in industrial history: the Very Large Scale Integration Technology Research Project.[^30]

Launched in 1976 with a budget of $281 million — half from government funds — the VLSI project brought together five fierce corporate rivals: Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, and Toshiba. Engineers from these competing firms were installed in a shared research laboratory in Kanagawa prefecture, south of Tokyo, and instructed to collaborate on the fundamental technologies of semiconductor fabrication.[^31]

Over four years, the project produced more than one thousand patents on microfabrication processes, achieved breakthroughs in electron-beam lithography, and established Japanese leadership in lithography equipment and silicon crystal technology.[^32] The results were staggering. Japanese semiconductor revenue share rocketed from roughly 15 percent of the global market in the early 1970s to 50 percent by the late 1980s, overtaking the United States. By 1985, Japanese producers had beaten American makers to the 256K-bit DRAM chip.[^33]

This was not laissez-faire capitalism. Nor was it central planning. It was something uniquely Japanese — a directed market economy in which government and industry moved in concert, guided by a shared vision of national competitiveness. And it created the technological ecosystem in which companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony would eventually build the machines that conquered the world's living rooms.

## The Island at the Edge

Of Hideki Sato's childhood in Hokkaido, the public record tells us almost nothing.

This is not unusual. Japanese engineers of Sato's generation — men born in the 1940s who spent their careers inside large corporations — were rarely the subjects of biography or public curiosity. The culture celebrated the company, the product, the team. Individual engineers, unless they rose to the very top of the corporate hierarchy or founded their own firms, tended to remain invisible to the wider world. Sato's name would eventually become known to gaming historians and Sega enthusiasts, but he never sought celebrity, never wrote a memoir aimed at a popular audience during the height of his career, and gave interviews primarily in Japanese-language trade publications.[^34]

What we know is this: he was born on November 5, 1948, in Hokkaido.[^35] The exact city or town has not been publicly documented. His family circumstances — whether his parents were farmers or shopkeepers or salaried workers, whether he had siblings, what kind of house he grew up in — remain private.

But Hokkaido itself tells us something. Japan's northernmost island was, and is, a place apart. Colonized relatively late in Japanese history — large-scale settlement by ethnic Japanese began only in the Meiji era of the late nineteenth century — Hokkaido had a frontier character that distinguished it from the ancient, densely settled regions of Honshu.[^36] Its climate was harsh: long winters, heavy snowfall, temperatures that plunged well below freezing. Its economy was agricultural and extractive — farming, fishing, forestry, coal mining. Sapporo, the island's largest city, was a regional capital rather than a great metropolis. The cultural intensity of Tokyo or Osaka or Kyoto — the concentration of universities, publishers, corporate headquarters, and creative ferment — was far away.

For a bright, technically inclined young person growing up in postwar Hokkaido, the path forward almost certainly led south. The best universities, the best companies, the best opportunities were on Honshu, clustered in the Tokyo-Osaka corridor. The journey from Hokkaido to Tokyo was not merely geographic. It was a passage from periphery to center, from agricultural hinterland to industrial heart, from the old Japan to the new.

## The Education of an Engineer

The school that young Hideki Sato entered in the early 1950s was a fundamentally different institution from the one his parents had known.

The American occupation had revolutionized Japanese education. The 1947 reform, overseen by SCAP and the Education Reform Council, replaced the old multi-track system — which had funneled students into separate academic and vocational paths from an early age — with a unified structure modeled on the American system: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, and three years of high school. Compulsory education was extended from six years to nine, encompassing all of elementary and junior high school.[^37]

The changes went deeper than structure. The prewar education system had been designed to produce loyal imperial subjects — obedient, patriotic, imbued with reverence for the emperor and the martial virtues. GHQ purged teachers with militaristic records and literally blacked out passages in existing textbooks with ink, rendering pages of imperial propaganda unreadable.[^38] The new Fundamental Law of Education, enacted in 1947, replaced the old values with principles of equal opportunity, full development of personality, and appreciation for truth and justice.[^39]

For children of Sato's generation, this meant growing up in a system that prized academic achievement above birth or class, that was — at least in aspiration — meritocratic, rigorous, and open. The examination system that would come to define Japanese education was already taking shape: entrance exams for high school, entrance exams for university, a relentless competition that sorted students into hierarchies of prestige that would follow them for the rest of their careers.

Mathematics and science received particular emphasis. A nation that had decided, at the deepest levels of policy, that its future lay in technology needed engineers, and producing engineers required a pipeline of technically literate young people. The curriculum was demanding by international standards, with Japanese students consistently outperforming their Western counterparts in standardized assessments of mathematical ability.[^40]

Sato graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Junior College — *Tōkyō Toritsu Kōgyō Tanki Daigaku* — in 1971.[^41] The school, located in the Samejima area of Tokyo near a Keikyū Line station, was one of the many technical colleges that occupied a distinctive niche in Japanese higher education.[^42] Technical colleges were popular among talented junior high school graduates; they offered direct paths to solid employment, and engineers with technical college qualifications earned strong professional reputations.[^43]

The choice of a technical college over a four-year university was significant. Japan's corporate world placed enormous weight on educational credentials — *gakureki* — and the hierarchy of universities functioned as a sorting mechanism for corporate recruitment. Graduates of Tokyo University, Kyoto University, or Waseda could expect doors to open at the most prestigious firms. Graduates of technical colleges entered the workforce with practical skills and respected qualifications, but many later reflected that they had missed the broader networks and prestige that a four-year degree conferred.[^44]

An irony haunted this system. While companies obsessed over educational pedigree in hiring, executives were often deeply dissatisfied with what universities actually taught. They regarded their new graduate recruits as people who had acquired "theoretically advanced, practically useless knowledge" and who looked down on hands-on workplace tasks.[^45] The solution was extensive in-house training: companies built their own education systems to transform raw graduates into functioning engineers. What you learned in school mattered less than where you had gone to school — and what you learned after you arrived at the company.

For someone emerging from a technical college in 1971, the education had been focused and practical. Sato's specific field of study has not been documented in public sources, but given his subsequent career in hardware engineering — designing the electronic guts of arcade machines and gaming consoles — a focus on electronics or electrical engineering is the most likely path.[^46]

## The Spirit of Making Things

To understand the world that Hideki Sato entered as a young engineer, it is necessary to understand a concept that has no precise English equivalent: *monozukuri*.

The word translates literally as "making things." But its meaning in Japanese culture runs far deeper than the English phrase suggests. *Monozukuri* encompasses a philosophy of manufacturing as disciplined craft — a synthesis of technological prowess, practical know-how, and a spirit of sincere dedication to the act of production. It implies pride, skill, and the relentless pursuit of perfection through incremental improvement.[^47]

The roots of *monozukuri* lie in centuries of Japanese craftsmanship. The swordsmiths who forged katanas through dozens of painstaking folds of heated steel. The potters who spent decades mastering a single glaze. The carpenters who built temple complexes without nails, relying instead on joints so precisely fitted that they locked together under their own weight. This tradition of patient mastery, of finding meaning in the perfection of process, survived Japan's modernization and found new expression in the factories and laboratories of the industrial age.[^48]

During the Meiji era of the late nineteenth century, Japan fused Western technology with this disciplined approach to craft. After the war, the fusion deepened. Rebuilding the economy placed quality at the center of Japanese manufacturing identity. The American statistician W. Edwards Deming, largely ignored in his home country, found an eager audience in Japan for his ideas about statistical process control and Total Quality Management. Toyota developed the Toyota Production System — later studied and imitated worldwide as "lean manufacturing" — with its emphasis on eliminating waste and empowering every worker on the assembly line to stop production if they spotted a defect.[^49]

The philosophy of *kaizen* — continuous improvement — became gospel in Japanese industry. Not revolutionary breakthroughs but steady, patient, incremental advances. Make it a little better today than it was yesterday. Measure. Adjust. Repeat. The cumulative effect of thousands of small improvements, compounded over years, produced products of extraordinary quality and reliability.

This was the ethos that permeated Japanese engineering culture in the 1960s and 1970s. It wasn't merely a management technique. It was a value system, almost a moral framework. In Japanese corporate culture, *how* something was achieved could matter as much as the result itself. Dedication, sincerity, and gradual improvement were celebrated as signs of integrity. The engineer who patiently refined a circuit design through dozens of iterations was not plodding — he was honorable.[^50]

For the generation of engineers coming of age in this period, *monozukuri* was not an abstract concept. It was the air they breathed. It shaped how they thought about problems, how they approached their work, how they measured their own worth. And it would shape the machines they built.

## The Corporate Covenant

The young engineer entering a Japanese company in 1971 was not merely taking a job. He was entering a covenant.

Postwar Japanese corporate culture rested on what became known as the "three sacred treasures" of industrial relations — *sanshu no jingi*, a deliberately grand term borrowed from the mythic regalia of the Japanese imperial house.[^51]

The first treasure was *shūshin koyō* — lifetime employment. A new graduate recruited into a major firm could expect continuous employment until retirement, typically at age sixty, in return for loyalty, dedication, and an implicit promise not to jump ship to a competitor. The system had roots in the prewar zaibatsu era, when major corporations began cultivating the same prestige traditionally ascribed to the feudal relationship between lord and retainer.[^52] Lifetime employment meant security — the knowledge that you would not be cast aside in a downturn, that the company would find a role for you even if your department was restructured. But it also meant commitment. Your career was the company. The company was your career. The two were not easily separated.

The second treasure was *nenkō joretsu* — the seniority-based advancement system. Promotions and wage increases were determined primarily by length of service and age rather than individual performance. A brilliant young engineer might chafe at watching older, less talented colleagues advance ahead of him, but the system had its logic: it rewarded patience, discouraged destructive internal competition, and built cohesion within teams whose members knew they would be working together for decades.[^53] It also made job-hopping economically irrational, since accumulated seniority could not be transferred to a new employer. You started at the bottom wherever you went.

The third treasure was the enterprise union — not a trade-based or industry-wide labor organization, but a union specific to a single company, organizing all employees regardless of occupation. This aligned workers' interests with the company's fortunes more closely than adversarial union models, creating a sense of shared destiny between management and labor.[^54]

Together, these three pillars created something remarkable: organizations that functioned almost like extended families, with their own internal hierarchies, their own mentorship systems, their own culture. The *senpai-kohai* relationship — the bond between senior and junior — was central. Older employees guided their juniors not only in professional skills but in navigating the complexities of office politics, social obligations, and corporate etiquette. The expectation was that today's *kohai* would, in time, become tomorrow's *senpai*, perpetuating the cycle of knowledge transfer and mutual obligation.[^55]

Decision-making in this world was collective, built through a two-stage process of consensus. First came *nemawashi* — literally "going around the roots," as a gardener prepares the soil before transplanting a tree — the informal, behind-the-scenes discussions that built agreement before any formal proposal was made. Then came *ringi*, the formal approval process in which a document circulated upward through the organizational hierarchy, collecting the stamp of each relevant manager along the way.[^56] By the time a meeting was convened to discuss a decision, the decision had, in essence, already been made. The meeting was ratification, not deliberation.

The system produced remarkable results. Teams of engineers, bound together by shared tenure and mutual trust, could undertake complex projects with a degree of coordination and commitment that their Western counterparts often struggled to match. The dark side was rigidity — difficulty adapting to rapid change, a tendency to suppress dissent, and working hours so extreme that the language eventually coined a word for their lethal consequence: *karōshi*, death by overwork.[^57]

But in 1971, the system was at its zenith. Japan's economy was booming. The corporate covenant was delivering prosperity on a scale that would have seemed hallucinatory to the survivors picking through the rubble of 1945.

## A Country Transformed

To grasp the sheer velocity of Japan's transformation, consider a single statistic. In December 1960, Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato had announced his Income Doubling Plan — *Shotoku Baizō Keikaku* — calling for an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent over the coming decade.[^58] The plan was considered ambitious. Some thought it reckless.

The actual results shattered all projections. Japan's economy grew at an average annual rate exceeding 10 percent. National income doubled not in ten years but in less than seven. Personal income doubled in just over four. By the time Ikeda left office, gross national product was growing at a phenomenal 13.9 percent per year.[^59]

The government poured investment into infrastructure at a pace that transformed the physical landscape. Highways, subways, airports, dams, port facilities — and, most spectacularly, the *Shinkansen*, the bullet train, which began service between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964, just in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The *Shinkansen* was more than a transportation project. It was a declaration: Japan was no longer rebuilding. Japan was leading.[^60]

In 1965, Japan's nominal GDP stood at roughly $91 billion. Fifteen years later, in 1980, it had soared to $1.065 trillion.[^61] The growth was driven by the rapid expansion of heavy manufacturing — automobiles, steel, shipbuilding — and, critically, by the electronics industry that MITI had nurtured with such strategic patience.

Sony had evolved from a tiny firm making transistor radios in a converted department store to a global electronics giant. Sharp, which had started as Hayakawa Electric in 1912, produced Japan's first transistorized electronic calculator in 1964 and would pioneer LCD technology.[^62] NEC built the PC-88 and PC-98 personal computers that would dominate Japanese computing for a generation.[^63] Matsushita — later Panasonic — built a consumer electronics empire. JVC, a subsidiary of Matsushita, developed the VHS videocassette format that won the bitter format war against Sony's Betamax.[^64]

Company by company, product by product, Japan's electronics manufacturers were rewriting the rules of global competition. The nation that had entered the 1950s unable to feed its population was, by the 1970s, flooding world markets with televisions, calculators, stereo equipment, and cameras of a quality that American and European competitors struggled to match.

In 1998, the Japanese Prime Minister's Office would formally enshrine this identity by establishing a *monozukuri* consultative council and enacting the Basic Law for Promoting Monozukuri Foundation Technology — an act of legislation that essentially declared manufacturing excellence to be part of the national heritage.[^65]

## The Threshold

In April 1971, Hideki Sato — twenty-two years old, freshly graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Junior College — walked into the offices of Sega Enterprises and began his career.[^66]

He was joining a company that most people, if they knew it at all, associated with jukeboxes and coin-operated amusement machines. Sega was not Sony. It was not Hitachi or Toshiba or NEC. It was an entertainment company with roots in the American military presence in Japan, founded to provide coin-operated diversions to servicemen on overseas bases.[^67] Its name was an abbreviation of "Service Games," and in 1971 it was still primarily a manufacturer of mechanical and electromechanical arcade equipment — a niche business in a country that was rapidly becoming the most sophisticated electronics market on earth.

But Sato had chosen engineering, and he had chosen Sega, and in doing so he had placed himself at the intersection of two currents that were about to converge with transformative force: Japan's mastery of electronics manufacturing, and the nascent art of interactive entertainment.

He could not have known, in April 1971, that within two years his colleagues would help introduce commercial video games to Japan.[^68] He could not have foreseen the golden age of arcades, the console wars, the rise and fall and rise of Sega, or the machines that would bear his name in the fine print of gaming history. He was a young engineer in a country of young engineers, part of a generation that had grown up watching their ruined nation reassemble itself into something astonishing through discipline, ingenuity, and the patient, relentless craft of making things.

The rubble of 1945 was twenty-six years in the past. The transistor radios had done their work — not merely as consumer products but as proof of concept, evidence that a small island nation with no natural resources to speak of could compete with the great industrial powers by outthinking and outengineering them. The economic miracle was no longer a miracle. It was a fact, a lived reality, a daily experience of escalators where there had been bomb craters, of neon where there had been blackout curtains, of bullet trains where there had been rubble.

And the generation that had grown up inside this transformation — Sato's generation, born in the ashes, educated in the new schools, trained in the *monozukuri* tradition of excellence through persistence — was just beginning to build.

The machines they would create had not yet been imagined. But the tools were ready, the skills honed, the current flowing.

All it needed was somewhere to go. And in a peculiar little company born from American slot machines and Japanese ambition, the place was waiting.
