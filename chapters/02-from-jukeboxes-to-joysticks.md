# Chapter 2: From Jukeboxes to Joysticks

*The accidental industry*

---

The jukebox is broken again.

It is 1953, and somewhere on a sprawling American military base in Japan — perhaps Yokota, perhaps Camp Drake, perhaps one of the dozens of installations that dot the archipelago like an occupier's constellation — a corporal in pressed khakis is staring at a Wurlitzer that has swallowed his dime and given him nothing but silence. He kicks it. Nothing. He flags down one of the Japanese technicians who service these machines, a young man in coveralls who bows slightly and produces a ring of keys. The back panel swings open to reveal a tangle of vacuum tubes, solenoids, and rubber belts — the guts of a machine designed to do one thing well: take coins and make noise.

This is the business that will become Sega.

Not video games. Not consoles. Not Sonic the Hedgehog sprinting through loop-de-loops. Jukeboxes. Slot machines. The clatter and flash of coin-operated amusement — entertainment measured in nickels, delivered by the pull of a lever or the drop of a quarter into a chrome-plated slot. The company that Hideki Sato would join, the company whose hardware he would define for two decades, began its life servicing machines in the back rooms of military recreation halls, thousands of miles from the Tokyo laboratories where its consoles would eventually be designed.[^1]

Every technology company has an origin myth. Apple has the garage. Nintendo has the playing-card workshop. Sega's origin story is stranger than any of these — a tale of American hustlers, Japanese reconstruction, Cold War geography, and the economics of keeping bored soldiers entertained. It stretches from Honolulu to Tokyo, from the slot parlors of occupied Japan to the boardrooms of a Manhattan conglomerate, and it explains something essential about the company that Sato would spend his career building: Sega was never quite one thing. It was American and Japanese, an entertainment company and a technology company, a maker of toys and a builder of serious machines. This duality would be both its greatest strength and the fault line that would eventually crack it apart.

## The Men from Honolulu

The story begins in paradise, with slot machines.

In May 1940, three American businessmen — Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and their associate James Humpert — incorporated a company called Standard Games in Honolulu, Hawaii.[^2] Their business was straightforward: provide coin-operated amusement machines to the American military bases that were rapidly expanding across the Pacific as war loomed. Slot machines, pinball tables, jukeboxes — anything that a soldier on leave might feed quarters into. It was a business model as old as standing armies: where there are young men with money and time, there is money to be made entertaining them.

The timing was impeccable. Within eighteen months, Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor transformed Hawaii into the most important military staging ground in the Pacific. Hundreds of thousands of American servicemen flowed through the islands. They needed diversions. Bromley and his partners were happy to oblige.[^3]

But the war that made their fortune also ended it. By 1945, with the conflict winding down and troop levels dropping, the partners dissolved Standard Games and briefly operated under the name California Games before shutting that venture down too.[^4] On September 1, 1946, they tried again, incorporating a new company under a name that made their clientele explicit: **Service Games** — as in, games for the armed services.[^5]

For six years, Service Games operated much as its predecessors had, distributing coin-operated machines across the Pacific. The business was profitable, if unglamorous. Then, in 1951, the United States government did something that would inadvertently create one of the world's great entertainment companies: it banned slot machines on military bases in all U.S. territories.[^6]

The law was aimed at organized crime, not at men like Bromley. But its effect was devastating — his entire domestic business model was suddenly illegal. Bromley needed a new market, and he found one across the Pacific. Japan was not a U.S. territory. It was an occupied nation, thick with American bases, full of soldiers with nothing to do. On February 15, 1952, Bromley dispatched two employees — Richard Stewart and Ray LeMaire — to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan.[^7]

It was a move of pure commercial opportunism. Bromley and his associates had no particular attachment to Japan, no vision of building a Japanese entertainment empire. They were following the money, which happened to be flowing through the pockets of GIs stationed in a country that was still rebuilding from the most catastrophic defeat in its modern history. And yet this commercial reflex — shipping slot machines to occupied Japan — planted the seed of everything that followed.

Within a year, the five partners formalized their international structure by establishing Service Games Panama as a holding company to coordinate operations across Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and South Vietnam.[^8] The company was growing, but it was also attracting attention. U.S. government investigators began looking into the business practices of the coin-operated amusement industry, and Service Games found itself caught up in the scrutiny. Though the investigation would ultimately find no criminal activity — a resolution that did not come until December 1964 — the cloud of suspicion prompted a corporate restructuring.[^9]

On May 31, 1960, Service Games of Japan was dissolved. Three days later, on June 3, Bromley established two new companies to continue the business: Nihon Goraku Bussan (roughly, "Japan Amusement Products") and Nihon Kikai Seizo ("Japan Machine Manufacturing").[^10] The companies operated under a brand name already familiar to their customers, an abbreviation stamped onto every jukebox and slot machine they had been selling for years. Take the first two letters of "Service." Take the first two letters of "Games." You get **SEGA**.[^11]

The name was catchy, even if no one yet imagined it would become one of the most recognized brands in the world. For now, Sega was simply what you called the jukeboxes.

## The Hustler from Brooklyn

While Bromley's crew was shipping coin machines around the Pacific, another American was making his own way to Japan — a man whose energy, salesmanship, and instinct for the entertainment business would transform Sega from a distributor of other people's machines into a company that built its own.

David Rosen grew up in Brooklyn, served in the United States Air Force, and was stationed in Japan during the postwar occupation.[^12] Like many Americans who passed through occupied Japan, Rosen saw a country in rubble. Unlike most of them, he also saw opportunity.

Decades later, Hideki Sato would remember Rosen with a warmth that cut through the usual corporate formality. "The founder was David Rosen — a Jewish American," Sato recalled. "He was very kind to me too."[^12a] It was a small remark, but it revealed something about the culture Rosen had built: a company where the man at the top knew the engineers on the floor, where a kid from Hokkaido who had stumbled into a job at a foreign-owned amusement firm could feel that the founder was personally kind to him. Rosen's Sega was not yet the sprawling multinational it would become. It was still small enough for kindness to be noticed and remembered.

The Japanese economy was primitive but growing fast. American goods were coveted. And there were gaps in the market that a sharp young man could fill.

In 1954, Rosen returned to Japan and started Rosen Enterprises.[^13] His first ventures were eclectic — he sold Japanese art to the American market and ran photography studios that produced the identification photos required by Japan's sprawling postwar bureaucracy. It was not glamorous work, but Rosen was learning how to operate in Japan, how to navigate a business culture profoundly different from anything he had known in Brooklyn, how to build relationships in a society where trust was earned slowly and maintained through meticulous attention to obligation and reciprocity.

By 1957, Rosen had found his real calling. He began importing coin-operated amusement machines — the same kinds of games that were filling American bowling alleys and pizza parlors — into Japan.[^14] It was a bet on a simple thesis: as Japan's economy grew and its people had more disposable income, they would want the same kinds of leisure entertainment that Americans enjoyed. Rosen was right. The economic miracle was accelerating — GDP growing at more than 10 percent annually — and a country that had been scratching for rice a few years earlier was suddenly generating a middle class with money to spend.[^15] Coin-operated amusement was perfectly positioned to capture those new yen.

Rosen was a natural showman, a salesman who understood that the amusement business was not really about machines — it was about feelings. The satisfying clunk of a coin dropping into a slot. The flash of lights. The thrill of competition. The brief escape from the grind of daily life. In this, he was temperamentally aligned with the culture he had adopted. Japan already had the world's largest mechanical amusement industry in the form of pachinko, whose parlors generated over one trillion yen annually by 1970.[^16] Rosen was not introducing a foreign concept; he was adding new instruments to an orchestra that was already playing.

## The Merger

By the early 1960s, two American-run companies were operating parallel amusement businesses in Japan: Bromley's Nihon Goraku Bussan (trading as Sega) and Rosen's Rosen Enterprises. They knew each other — in the small world of coin-operated entertainment in Japan, everyone did. In 1965, the inevitable happened: the two companies merged.[^17]

The resulting entity took its name from both parents. "Sega" came from Nihon Goraku Bussan's existing brand — the abbreviation that had been stamped on jukeboxes for years. "Enterprises" came from Rosen Enterprises. Together: **Sega Enterprises, Ltd.** David Rosen became chairman and chief executive officer.[^18]

The merger was more than a corporate convenience. It combined Bromley's infrastructure — the distribution networks, the service operations, the relationships with military and civilian customers — with Rosen's entrepreneurial drive and his instinct that the amusement business needed to evolve beyond distributing other companies' machines. Sega needed to build its own.

The first proof of concept came in 1966, when Sega created **Periscope**, its first original game.[^19] It was not a video game — the technology for that was still a decade away. Periscope was an electromechanical marvel: a large cabinet in which players peered through a mock submarine telescope, scanning a painted ocean backdrop while cardboard ships moved on chains and a grid of lights simulated torpedoes streaking through the water. It was ingenious, immersive, and wildly popular. The game became the first Japanese-made arcade export, shipped to amusement parlors across the United States and Europe. Its success was so pronounced that it prompted operators to raise the standard price of play from ten cents to twenty-five cents — a pricing revolution that tripled revenue per play and fundamentally altered the economics of the arcade business.[^20]

Periscope revealed something crucial about Sega's DNA. The game was not sophisticated in any computational sense — it used motors, lights, and painted cardboard, not circuits and code. But it was brilliant in its understanding of *experience*. The periscope viewfinder created a sense of immersion. The moving ships created tension. The light-torpedo effect created drama. Sega, from its very first original product, was an entertainment company that used technology in the service of feeling. This would matter enormously as the decades unfolded, because it meant that Sega's engineers — including, eventually, Hideki Sato — would always be building machines whose purpose was not computation but *delight*.

## Swallowed by the Conglomerate

Success has a way of attracting attention, and by the late 1960s, Sega was attracting plenty. The arcade business was booming, Japan's economy was soaring, and David Rosen had built Sega into the dominant amusement company in the country. In 1969, Sega was sold to Gulf and Western Industries, a sprawling American conglomerate whose holdings ranged from Paramount Pictures to zinc mining.[^21]

The price was $10 million for the 80 percent stake held by Bromley and Stewart, while LeMaire retained his 20 percent. As a condition of the sale, Rosen agreed to remain as CEO until at least 1972.[^22] It was the classic bargain of the conglomerate era: a founder trades independence for capital and corporate backing, betting that the resources of a giant parent will accelerate growth.

For a while, the bet paid off. Under Gulf and Western's ownership, Sega's arcade business expanded aggressively. Revenue grew from $37 million in 1979 to $150 million in 1981 and nearly $215 million in 1982.[^23] Sega was riding the global arcade boom that had been ignited by Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and supercharged by Namco's Pac-Man in 1980 — a boom that saw arcade cabinets colonize every shopping mall, convenience store, and pizza parlor in the developed world. Sega contributed its own hits, including Zaxxon, the 1982 isometric shooter that demonstrated the company's flair for visual innovation.[^24]

But the arcade industry, like all boom industries, carried the seeds of its own correction. By 1982, the market was saturating. Too many machines chasing too few quarters. In the United States, the broader video game market was collapsing — the infamous crash of 1983 that buried Atari and nearly killed the American gaming industry. The arcade side was not immune. Sega's revenue plummeted to $136 million in 1983.[^25]

Gulf and Western, a conglomerate already under pressure from investors demanding focus, decided that the amusement business was not worth the trouble. In September 1983, it sold Sega's North American arcade manufacturing operations and the licensing rights to its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing.[^26] The Japanese subsidiary — the heart of the company, the part that actually designed and built the machines — was suddenly orphaned.

## Nakayama's Vision

Into this vacuum stepped the man who would reshape Sega's destiny and, in doing so, create the company that Hideki Sato would help build into a console powerhouse.

Hayao Nakayama was not, by background or temperament, a corporate politician. Born in 1932, he had started his career in the amusement industry not in a boardroom but on the road, as a jukebox leasing salesman.[^27] He understood these machines at the level of their springs and solenoids, their belt drives and coin mechanisms. From leasing, he moved into distribution, founding Esco Trading Company (Esco Boueki), a coin-operated machine distributor that Sega had eventually acquired, bringing Nakayama into the fold.[^28]

Nakayama was a pragmatist with a visionary streak — a combination that is rarer than it sounds. When Gulf and Western signaled its desire to exit, Nakayama saw not a crisis but an opening. Working with David Rosen, he arranged a management buyout of Sega's Japanese subsidiary in 1984. The financial backing came from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software and services company whose chairman, Isao Okawa, had the resources and the appetite for a bold bet on entertainment technology.[^29]

The deal valued Sega's Japanese assets at $38 million.[^30] CSK took a 20 percent stake, and Okawa became chairman of the newly independent Sega Enterprises, Ltd. Nakayama was installed as CEO — the first time in the company's history that a Japanese executive, rather than an American, held the top operational role.[^31]

This was more than a change of management. It was a change of identity. For its entire existence, Sega had been an American enterprise operating on Japanese soil — founded by Americans, run by Americans, owned by an American conglomerate. The 1984 buyout began what one industry chronicler described as a "decade-long corporate transition from U.S. company to a traditional Japanese company."[^32] The shift would reshape everything: the company's decision-making culture, its relationship with employees, its approach to product development, and — most critically for our story — the kind of engineers it attracted and the kind of work it asked them to do.

But Nakayama's most consequential decision was strategic, not cultural. The arcade business was declining. The home console market, by contrast, was exploding — Nintendo's Famicom, launched on July 15, 1983, had conquered Japan and was about to conquer the world.[^33] Nakayama looked at Sega's capabilities — its deep engineering talent, its experience designing arcade hardware, its understanding of what made games compelling — and reached a conclusion that was obvious in retrospect but audacious at the time: Sega should build home consoles.

The logic was elegant. Arcade machines and home consoles were, at the hardware level, variations on the same theme: a processor, graphics chips, sound hardware, input devices, and software designed to entertain. Sega had been building arcade boards for years. Its engineers understood graphics rendering, sprite manipulation, sound synthesis, and the dozens of other technical challenges involved in making a machine that could put compelling images on a screen. The leap from arcade cabinet to living room console was significant — the cost constraints were brutally different, and the market dynamics were entirely foreign — but the core engineering competence transferred.[^34]

Nakayama was pushing Sega into the console market not because the company had a long history in consumer electronics, but because the arcade downturn demanded diversification and the engineering talent was already in the building. It was, in the best sense, an improvisation — a company playing the hand it had been dealt, using skills developed for one purpose in pursuit of another.

## The SG-1000: A Date with Destiny

The result was the **SG-1000**, Sega's first home video game console, released on July 15, 1983.[^35] The date is one of those coincidences that history seems to arrange for dramatic effect: it was the exact same day that Nintendo released the Famicom. Two Japanese companies, both rooted in the amusement business, both making their first serious play for the living room, launching head-to-head on the same summer morning.

The SG-1000 was a modest machine — technically competent but not revolutionary, powered by a Zilog Z80 processor and a Texas Instruments TMS9918A video display processor.[^36] It was built by Sega's hardware team, engineers who had cut their teeth designing arcade boards and were now trying to solve the very different problem of building a consumer device that could be manufactured cheaply, sold at retail, and operated by people who did not know a Z80 from a zipper.

Among those engineers was a man named Hideki Sato.

The SG-1000 sold respectably in Japan — the console series, including its Mark III successor, moved over 1.4 million units by 1988.[^37] But it was thoroughly outclassed by the Famicom, which would go on to sell tens of millions and establish Nintendo as the undisputed ruler of the Japanese console market. Sega had arrived at the party, but it was standing in Nintendo's shadow.

Still, the SG-1000 mattered more than its sales figures suggested. It proved that Sega could build a consumer console. It forced the company to develop competencies in manufacturing, retail distribution, and consumer marketing that were entirely different from the arcade business. And it gave Sega's hardware engineers — Sato prominent among them — their first experience with the specific constraints and possibilities of home console design: the cost targets, the thermal limits, the need for reliability over thousands of hours of use by consumers who would never open the case.

The SG-1000 was a beginning, not an ending. And for Sega, the company born from slot machines and jukeboxes, the company that bore an American name and was only now becoming Japanese, the company whose DNA was entertainment rather than technology — the console business would become the arena in which its greatest triumphs and most devastating failures would unfold.

## An Entertainment Company's Soul

To understand the company that Hideki Sato helped build, you must understand what it was not. Sega was not Sony, a consumer electronics giant whose engineering culture was rooted in transistor radios, television sets, and the disciplined pursuit of miniaturization. Sega was not NEC, a telecommunications company that approached the console market as an extension of its computer business. And Sega was certainly not Nintendo, a former playing-card company that had been reborn under the iron will of Hiroshi Yamauchi as a ruthlessly disciplined entertainment platform.

Sega was an amusement company. Its roots were in the physical, tactile, slightly disreputable world of coin-operated entertainment — the world of pachinko parlors and bowling alleys, of game centers and amusement arcades. Its institutional memory was not of circuit board design reviews or semiconductor roadmaps but of testing whether a cabinet's joystick felt right under a player's hand, whether a game's first thirty seconds were compelling enough to earn another quarter, whether the sounds and lights of a machine could lure a passerby across a crowded arcade floor.

This heritage gave Sega something that no amount of engineering sophistication could replace: an instinct for fun. When Sega's hardware engineers designed a console, they were not building a computer that happened to play games. They were building a game machine whose technology served the experience. The distinction sounds subtle, but it is the difference between designing from the spec sheet up and designing from the player's fingers down. It shaped every console Sega ever made — the aggressive performance targets of the Genesis, the multimedia ambitions of the Saturn, the online audacity of the Dreamcast.

But the amusement heritage also carried liabilities. Arcade businesses operated on different rhythms than consumer electronics. In the arcade world, you deployed machines to locations you controlled, serviced them with your own technicians, and replaced them when something better came along. The feedback loop was tight and physical — if a game was not earning, you could see the empty coin boxes. The console business was utterly different: you shipped a product to millions of anonymous consumers through retail channels you did not control, and you lived or died by decisions made years in advance about processor architectures and developer tools. Sega would struggle with this transition for its entire life as a console maker.

## The Identity Fault Line

There was a deeper tension, too — one that ran through the company's identity like a geological fault.

Sega was, by origin and founding, an American company. Its founders were American. Its first chairman was American. Its corporate language, its business instincts, its entrepreneurial swagger — all of these came from the American side. David Rosen's Sega was a company that took risks, moved fast, and trusted the gut instincts of its leaders. It was, in spirit, a company from Brooklyn — brash, improvisational, willing to hustle.

But after the 1984 buyout, Sega was becoming Japanese. Nakayama brought Japanese management practices, Japanese decision-making processes, and a Japanese sensibility about the relationship between a company and its employees. Under CSK's ownership, the consensus-building *ringi* system took hold, decisions moved through formal channels, and the bonds of loyalty and seniority that defined Japanese corporate life began to shape how Sega operated.[^38]

This was not simply a matter of corporate governance. It was a question of soul. The American entrepreneurial instinct and the Japanese corporate ethic are not incompatible, but they are different in ways that matter when crunch decisions must be made: when a product must be killed, when a market must be abandoned, when a rival must be confronted head-on. The American way is to decide fast, act decisively, and accept the casualties. The Japanese way is to build consensus, move carefully, and protect relationships — even when speed might be more valuable than harmony.

Sega never fully resolved this tension. In the late 1980s and 1990s, it would manifest as an increasingly bitter rivalry between Sega of Japan and Sega of America — two halves of the same company operating with fundamentally different philosophies, each convinced the other did not understand the market.[^39] The American side would innovate aggressively in marketing and consumer strategy, capturing 65 percent of the U.S. 16-bit market by 1992.[^40] The Japanese side would override, second-guess, and ultimately undermine those innovations, driven by what many American executives perceived as a toxic blend of institutional conservatism and wounded pride.

"They didn't trust us, and they didn't understand our market," one Sega of America executive would later recall. "So we would turn down titles, and they were insulted that we would turn down their side-scrolling shooting games. And at the upper levels, they really wanted us just to behave, to do what they wanted us to do, to be a carbon copy."[^41]

This dynamic would haunt Sega through the Genesis years, the Saturn debacle, and into the Dreamcast era. It is a thread that runs through every chapter of this book, because the hardware that Hideki Sato designed was shaped by the organizational culture in which he worked — and that culture was, from the very beginning, divided against itself.

## Becoming Japanese

Yet the transition was also productive. As Sega became more Japanese in its culture and operations, it gained access to something invaluable: the deep well of engineering talent that Japan's postwar education system and corporate culture had produced.

The Japan of the mid-1980s was, arguably, the most sophisticated consumer electronics ecosystem in the world. Sega could now recruit engineers trained in the same *monozukuri* tradition as their counterparts at Sony and NEC — engineers who understood chip architecture, circuit board layout, thermal management, and manufacturing tolerances — and put them to work on a unique problem: building machines whose purpose was not communication or computation but play.[^42]

The result was a hardware R&D culture that combined the rigor of Japanese electronics engineering with the improvisational creativity of the amusement business. It was, in its best moments, a remarkable synthesis — producing machines that were technically ambitious, aesthetically distinctive, and designed from the ground up to deliver experiences that no one else was offering.

## The Stage Is Set

By the mid-1980s, the pieces were in place. Sega had its independence, freed from Gulf and Western's indifference. It had its leader, Nakayama, with his vision of a company that could compete with Nintendo in the living room. It had its financial backer in CSK and Isao Okawa, a man whose commitment to the company would prove to be almost inconceivably deep — Okawa would eventually loan Sega $500 million of his personal fortune and, on his deathbed, forgive the entire debt.[^44] It had its American connections, with David Rosen still involved and the eventual establishment of Sega of America as an autonomous subsidiary in 1986.[^45] And it had its engineering heritage, decades of building machines designed to entertain, now being channeled into the new frontier of home consoles.

What it needed were the engineers who could turn that vision into silicon and solder. It needed people who could design the custom chips, lay out the circuit boards, and solve the thousand small problems that stand between a concept and a product. It needed hardware engineers — Japanese hardware engineers, trained in the postwar tradition of precision and perseverance — who could take the institutional knowledge accumulated through years of arcade development and translate it into consumer products capable of competing with Nintendo's formidable Famicom.

It needed people like Hideki Sato.

But first, it is worth pausing to appreciate the improbability of the company Sato joined. A firm founded by Americans in Hawaii to ship slot machines to military bases. Renamed after an abbreviation stamped on jukeboxes. Sold to a conglomerate, bought back by its own managers, and reinvented as a Japanese console maker. A company whose identity was permanently caught between two cultures, two countries, two ways of doing business.

From this unlikely origin, Sega would launch itself into a war for the living room that would consume the industry for the next two decades. And at the center of its hardware efforts, quietly designing the machines around which that war would be fought, would be the engineer whose story this book tells.
