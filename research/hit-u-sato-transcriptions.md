# INTERVIEW 1: CHILDHOOD AND PATH TO SEGA

## Part 1: Childhood Life (WP#18-16)

### Birth and Family Background

Sato was born in 1950 in Ashibetsu (芦別), a coal mining town in Hokkaido. He was the eldest of three children -- a sister Yoshiko (好子, born 1954) and brother Naoki (born 1955). His father was born in 1924 (Taisho 13) and died at age 76; his mother was born in 1927 (Showa 2) and died at age 68.

**Sato on his name:** "When I later asked why they named me Hideki, they said it was because Hideki Yukawa won the Nobel Prize, so they borrowed the name. My father probably couldn't be bothered to think of one (laughs). The proof is that my sister is Yoshiko -- literally 'good child' -- and my brother is Naoki. They named me Hideki, so they just went with 'well, Naoki then.' Pretty slapdash naming."

### Constant Moves in Hokkaido

His father was a saw sharpener (目立て師) for sawmills, maintaining the enormous blades used in lumber processing. This required the family to move constantly -- approximately every 1-1.5 years -- throughout the Sorachi District (空知郡) of Hokkaido. Key locations included Ashibetsu, Nokanan (野花南, near Furano), Shimanoshita (島ノ下), and Utashinai (歌志内).

**Sato:** "My father, for better or worse, was a bit unusual. Put positively, he was very Americanized -- if someone recognized his skills and asked him to come, he'd move. But his personality was difficult. When they recruited him, they'd say 'Please, we need you.' But once he was actually working there, the managers would find him hard to deal with, and things would sour. Then after a year or two, another offer would come. He was apparently quite skilled."

**On the impact of constant transfers:** "If I transferred to a new school, the first few months were really lonely. No friends, nobody you know. Then just when you'd finally made friends and settled in, it was time to transfer again. After repeating this over and over, your personality gets a bit twisted."

### Childhood Poverty and Food

The family was extremely poor. Sato describes meals of frozen whale meat sliced into sashimi, miso soup, and little else. Beef was unknown to him -- when he asked his mother about it, she told him it was "smelly and no good," though he later discovered it was delicious. The once-a-year Christmas cake was a highlight.

**Sato on discovering spaghetti:** "When I was around middle school age, I ate instant spaghetti Napolitan for the first time, and I was moved. There was practically nothing in it -- just ketchup flavor. But noodles that weren't soba or udon! I thought, 'Something this delicious exists?'"

**On the local food store:** "In Shimanoshita there were only two stores. One sold various foodstuffs, but had no refrigeration. Mother bought some fish cake from there and was grilling it. Then suddenly -- maggots started coming out. The heat was driving them out. That's how bad food hygiene was."

### Early Personality

Sato describes himself as fundamentally shy and introverted, but capable of becoming very boisterous when comfortable. He thrived on praise, especially from female teachers.

**Sato:** "When I was being praised and doing well, I was very active -- noisy, even. Teachers would write on my report card that I 'lacked composure.' But fundamentally, I think I'm quiet. Very shy, introverted, a bit of a people-avoider. But if someone acknowledges me, I get carried away. In Hokkaido, they call it 'odatsu' -- getting puffed up, getting ahead of yourself."

**On an early fortune-telling:** "My mother once took me to a fortune-teller who said, 'This child is a late bloomer.' So whenever I was failing, she'd say, 'You're no good now, but maybe that fortune will come true and you'll improve someday.'"

### Childhood Play and Early Technical Interests

His childhood was full of improvised outdoor activities -- catching dragonflies with spiderweb nets (since they couldn't afford real nets), fishing for kajika (sculpin) using glass shards as makeshift goggles, eating mulberries from trees, and playing with marbles and menko.

**On eating insects:** "I've eaten dragonflies. You pull off the head, remove the tail, strip the legs and wings, and eat it. It wasn't very good. I also caught bees, removed the stinger, and ate those -- they're actually a bit sweet."

His earliest technical interest came from plastic model tanks: "I loved model tanks, especially the Tiger tank. The batteries ran out quickly, so I researched what to do about it. I learned about 'storage batteries' -- capacitors -- and transformers. I understood you could step down voltage and supply power. But I couldn't figure out the next step -- you need to rectify the current to DC. That was beyond a kid's brain."

### Move to Tokyo

Around 1963-64, when Sato was about 13, the family moved to Tokyo. His father's sawmill work had dried up as Hokkaido's local timber industry declined due to foreign lumber imports. The father went ahead alone, first as a seasonal worker at Prince Motors (later absorbed by Nissan) in Musashimurayama, then obtained permanent employment. The family joined him in a small government housing complex in Kobiki-cho, Hachioji -- a 2K apartment (6-mat room, 3-mat room, tiny kitchen) for five people.

## Part 2: From Middle School to Joining Sega (WP#18-17)

### Middle School and High School

At Hachioji Seventh Middle School, Sato struggled with the Hokkaido dialect -- classmates mocked him and called him "Tagosaku" (a derogatory term for country bumpkin). He also describes being attracted to a neighbor girl and failing an exam for Fujimori High School.

He attended Tokyo Metropolitan Hino High School (東京都立日野高校), which was newly established -- he was in its first graduating class. The school initially used prefab buildings. He joined the physics club and built a lie detector for the school festival.

**Sato on high school:** "The school had a unique culture -- being the very first graduating class, there was a sense of building something from nothing. The first year was all prefabricated buildings. No traditions, no precedents."

### Junior College

After failing university entrance exams (Chiba University first round, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology second round), Sato attended Tokyo Metropolitan College of Industrial Technology (東京都立工業短期大学) in Samezu, studying electrical engineering. He received a scholarship of 5,000 yen per month, which more than covered tuition.

He joined the ESS (English Speaking Society) and developed a desire to go abroad. He applied twice to the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV) but was rejected both times -- once in Saitama (where he was caught pretending to be a farmer) and once in Tokyo.

### Walking into Sega (c. March 25, 1971)

With no job prospects and everyone else in his class already placed, Sato went to the school's career office around March 25th. The placement teacher offered Fujisoku (a switch manufacturer). Sato's response became a defining anecdote:

**Sato:** "'A switch that goes click and electricity flows? A plug you stick in and current passes through? Sensei, that's boring.' He got angry: 'You come to me this late, I'm offering you the one place where I have connections, and you say it's boring? Fine. Go upstairs to the career resource room and find something yourself.'"

He tried Tomy (the toy company) -- already closed for recruiting. Then he found Sega's brochure: slot machines, arcade games, jukeboxes. Foreign-owned (half-days on Fridays). Starting salary about 32,000 yen. Located at Otorii on the Keikyu line -- just two stops from his school.

**Sato:** "I figured if I called, they'd probably say recruiting was closed. So I decided to just go there in person."

At Sega's office, three strokes of luck aligned: (1) it was late March and HR had nothing to do; (2) the HR section chief was from the same metropolitan university system; (3) the development department had a vacancy -- they'd planned to hire three but only got two.

**Sato:** "I got a full tour of the company. The jukebox operation -- Sega was dominant. While we were walking through, Fuji Keiko [the singer] walked past and gave a little bow. He showed me a room with over 100,000 records."

After a 15-minute impromptu interview with the development department head (Takahashi) and deputy, he was hired on the spot -- no entrance exam, no transcripts, no health checkup.

**Sato:** "It was all verbal -- just talking and bluffing (laughs) and sheer luck. Later, when Sega became famous, they'd get tens of thousands of applicants. I would never have gotten in through that process -- absolutely impossible."

He entered Sega on April 1, 1971. About 150 new hires total; 3 in development. He left Sega in 2008.

### Early Work at Sega

His first assignment was workshop fabrication -- cutting sheet metal, drilling holes, bending materials. He quickly learned to prioritize: asking researchers which dimensions were critical and cutting corners on the rest. This earned him both admiration and assignments to bigger projects.

**Sato on his approach:** "I asked, 'What's the most important part?' The chain attachment dimension was critical. Everything else? 'Two or three millimeters off is fine.' So I was precise on the critical part and eyeballed everything else. Result? Fast. My supervisor was surprised. Of course I was fast -- I was cutting corners."

He was sent to Osaka for 3-6 months to build an enormous diorama in the Kintetsu Building (model cars and trains). Then he was assigned to pinball (flipper) development, where his team of three would bet on wire identification and play-test machines with real money.

### Key Early Sega People

- **Takahashi** -- Development department head; became Sato's wedding go-between
- **Ochi Shikanosuke (越智止戈之助)** -- Senior to Takahashi; color-blind but brilliant designer; patented the trackball for arcade use; licensed it to Namco; "an incredible idea man"
- **Ishikawa** -- Already in development when Sato joined; designed the mechanics for Hang-On; later worked with Sato at his post-Sega company

# INTERVIEW 2: TV GAME DEVELOPMENT AND NINTENDO COMPETITION

## Part 1: Beginning TV Game Development (WP#18-18)

### The PONG Shock and Mastering ICs

When Atari's PONG arrived (via "PONTRON" -- Sega's copy), Sato was shocked: "TV was something you watched. Using TV for a game -- that was revolutionary." The circuit boards were packed with ICs he'd never seen -- SSI gates, TTL logic. But his relay background made the transition natural.

**Sato:** "Relays in series give you AND. Relays in parallel give you OR. So logic ICs were incredibly easy to use. And MSI chips like counters -- building a counter with relays would be enormously difficult, but it all fit into a 16-pin package."

He mastered TV signal generation: "For the first time, I understood horizontal sync signals, vertical sync signals. Then I could freely produce images."

### Aggressive Engineering

Sato describes rotating monitors 90 degrees for driving games, using analog manipulation to create road curves and perspective, and building increasingly elaborate pinball machines with 3D elements, magnets under the playfield, and up to five balls simultaneously in play.

**Sato on the "Road Race" (February 1976):** "I used analog manipulation to shift where circles appeared on screen, creating road curves and perspective. The number of adjustment potentiometers was absurd."

**Sato's philosophy:** "Back then, the attitude was 'if it breaks, it breaks.' Games only last two or three years anyway, so why design for five or ten years?"

### Gremlin Industries Acquisition

Around seven Sega employees, including Sato, were sent to Los Angeles for two months to learn software at Gremlin Industries (which Sega had acquired). Their teacher was Argo Kish.

**Key takeaway -- the System Board philosophy:** "Gremlin created the G80 -- 'G' for Gremlin, '80' for Z80. By establishing it as a system board, you didn't need to design a new board for every game. Same board, different software content, new game. I inherited this philosophy and later created SYSTEM 1, SYSTEM 2, and so on."

### Microcomputer Revelation

The pinball machine "Rodeo" was Sega's first to use a microcomputer (Intel 4040). Sato decided to build his own system: "I took an Intel 8080, set it up at home on a universal board, connected a junk-shop keyboard, and programmed it. Only then did I finally understand."

**Sato:** "Once I understood microcomputers, doing everything in random logic seemed absurd. For me, the progression was: relays, then TTL ICs, then microcomputers. Each step was a revelation of convenience."

### First Gate Array

**Sato:** "The very first gate array at Sega was one I designed -- 550 gates. It didn't work at first because I'd changed logic polarity during design but forgot to update the board."

## Part 2: Competition with Nintendo in Home Consoles (WP#18-19)

### David Rosen and Sega's Origins

**Sato:** "The founder was David Rosen -- a Jewish American. He was very kind to me too. What he first brought to Japan was photo machines -- those automatic photo booths called 'Photorama.'"

### Entering Consumer Games: SC-3000 and SG-1000

Before the SG-1000, Sega released the SC-3000 (Sega Computer 3000) at 29,800 yen. Sato partnered with Foster Electric for cost reduction.

**Sato on the consumer team:** "Consumer business was marginal compared to arcade. When they said 'send people to the consumer division,' what showed up were the castoffs. A kind of dumping ground."

The SG-1000 was essentially the SC-3000 without a keyboard, rushed out after hearing Nintendo was making a console. It launched on the same day as the Famicom: July 15, 1983.

**Sato:** "I'll be honest -- the graphics were terrible. I thought, 'How is this going to sell?' Then it sold 160,000 units. Everyone was flabbergasted. That's because the Famicom was sold out. I went to a department store for year-end sales. When customers came asking for the Famicom and it was sold out, I'd say, 'Here, this is Sega's Famicom.'" [Everyone laughs]

### Software Weakness

**Sato:** "The software was awful. Meanwhile, Nintendo had 'Donkey Kong' -- a killer title with excellent quality."

**On third-party relations:** "Sega couldn't build good third-party relationships. Arcade was the main business; consumer was an afterthought. When Square or Enix made requests, Sega's attitude was 'Who cares?'"

### Hardware Iteration

- SG-1000 Mark II (July 1984) -- new mold, new design
- Mark III (1985) -- new Yamaha-derived graphics chip
- But in Japan, Sega could never beat Nintendo: "It all came down to software."

### Nintendo's Licensing Model

**Sato:** "Nintendo brilliantly studied why Atari failed. They created a licensing system -- contracts, royalties, quality control. Sega copied this model."

### The SH Processor Name Origin

For Saturn, Sega chose Hitachi's new RISC CPU -- the SH series. **Sato:** "I told Hitachi to come up with a better name. They spent 5-6 million yen researching. Finally: 'SH stands for Sato Hideki!' And 'Sega-Hitachi.' And 'Shoubai Hanjou [prosperous business].' I said, 'Fine, whatever.'"

### MSX and Kazuhiko Nishi

**Sato:** "I met with Nishi. His conclusion was: 'Sega should stop doing hardware and become a software company.' Nakayama found Nishi's attitude intolerable and killed the idea immediately."

# INTERVIEW 3: HARDWARE/SOFTWARE, SATURN, DREAMCAST

## Part 1: Hardware and Software in Games (WP#18-20)

### CSK/Okawa Isao Acquires Sega

Okawa Isao (大川功), founder of CSK, purchased Sega from Paramount for approximately 8 billion yen. Sony's Ohga Norio had nearly acquired Sega first -- he came to negotiate but was ultimately outbid.

**Sato on Ohga:** "Ohga set the CD length at 64 minutes because that's how long Beethoven's Ninth is. He was an orchestra conductor."

### Mega Drive and Semiconductor Partnerships

For the Mega Drive, Sato procured the MC68000 from Signetics at an astonishing 300 yen per unit (the normal price was around 3,000 yen) by guaranteeing 300,000 units.

**Sato on FM sound and Yamaha:** "The FM chip existed in Yamaha's musical instrument division. Their president Kawakami ordered the release to Sega. That FM sound became the standard for PC sound -- the Sound Blaster was essentially the same architecture."

### The Tetris License Disaster

Sega had huge success with Tetris in arcades, then developed a Mega Drive version. But Nintendo made an end-run to ELORG (the Soviet rights holder) and secured home console rights.

**Sato:** "We had already produced the cartridges. They had to be destroyed."

### The Birth of Sonic

**Sato on Yuji Naka:** "An obsessive perfectionist programmer/director." Sonic was designed to be completely different from Mario.

**Sato on U.S. success:** "SOA's comparative advertising was brilliant. They beat Nintendo 55-44 in U.S. market share."

### Super 32X Failure

**Sato:** "We wasted about 3 billion yen on Samsung DSP chips for the Super 32X that were mostly unused."

### EA's Reverse-Engineering and Lawsuit

**Sato:** "EA reverse-engineered our boot ROM security and made their own cartridges. We sued; they counter-sued. The Coyle patent case cost us 57 billion yen."

## Part 2: Saturn, Dreamcast, and Transition to Software (WP#18-21)

### Saturn Architecture

The Saturn used dual Hitachi SH-2 CPUs. Sato chose a sprite-based architecture rather than polygon-based, partly to accommodate existing software teams.

**Sato on Kutaragi (PlayStation creator):** "Kutaragi and I are the same age -- he's 2-3 months older. We had a friendly personal relationship and dined together regularly. He once told me frankly: 'You can't beat me. Sony has its own factories, its own semiconductor capability. You're relying on suppliers. The only way to compete is if both companies are on equal footing -- and they're not.'"

### Saturn's Fatal Flaw: No SDK

**Sato:** "The biggest problem was having virtually no libraries for the new hardware. What we gave developers as 'libraries' was really just portions of application software. We got absolutely hammered by third-party developers."

**On why:** "There was no mindset for it. Our software teams could figure things out on their own. But for home consoles, the most important thing is third parties."

### The Dreamcast Architecture War

A parallel development competition between Japanese and American teams for Dreamcast's architecture became one of the most dramatic episodes:

- **Japan team:** Hitachi SH-4 CPU, NEC graphics (VideoLogic tile architecture), Yamaha sound
- **America team:** Mainstream CPU, 3dfx graphics, E-mu sound

**Sato on incentive structures:** "The American team prioritized goals with bonuses: Priority #1: Cost ($3,000 bonus). #2: Performance ($2,000). So they'd cut anything that raised cost even if it improved performance. The Japanese engineers had no bonuses -- just salary. But they'd agonize over every tradeoff: 'This adds 200 yen but gives 20% more polygons.' I'd say: 'Do it.'"

**The "Imperial Conference":** "Eventually there was a showdown meeting. Irimajiri had lobbied everyone -- most of the company was on his side. He was president; I was just a managing director. I thought I had a 95% chance of losing."

**Sato:** "But then something unexpected emerged: the president of Sega of America had been receiving stock from 3dfx. That was part of why he'd been pushing their architecture."

**Okawa's decisive reasoning:** "'Sato has failed many times -- 8-bit, Saturn, many failures. So he must have learned many things. Therefore, he probably won't fail this time.' That's how it was decided."

**Aftermath with Irimajiri:** "Irimajiri said: 'This company is crazy. How did your proposal win?' I told him: 'Why did you, as president, come down to my level to argue about hardware specs? That's not your job. Because you descended to my level, I won -- I have more battle experience.'"

### NEC Yield Problems and Launch

NEC's graphics chip had terrible manufacturing yields, leading to immediate inventory shortages at launch.

**Sato:** "And as usual -- terrible launch software. 'Pen Pen TriIcelon,' 'Godzilla Generations' -- absolutely appalling."

### Internet and the ACCESS Browser

Microsoft's browser effort was "half-hearted." Sato went to ACCESS and paid about 50 million yen in development fees. The ACCESS browser shipped with Dreamcast.

**Sato on showing Okawa the internet:** "I connected the Dreamcast to a large TV in his office and showed him adult websites. He needed to understand the risk. His reaction: 'Well, it can't be helped. We'll put in some parental controls, but it's the internet.'"

### Okawa Discovers Financial Irregularities

**Sato:** "Okawa discovered massive loans to subsidiaries -- 35 billion yen to Sega of America, 20-something billion to Europe. Under standalone accounting, the lending looked like assets and subsidiary purchases looked like revenue. When Okawa figured this out, he was furious. Nakayama was removed as president."

### The Transition to Software

In 2000, Sega announced it would become an "architecture holder" -- deliberately vague code for exiting hardware. Around February 2001, the real announcement came. Okawa died March 16, 2001.

**Sato:** "Since 1983, I'd been doing consumer hardware. To have given birth to and raised these products, only to be the one to bury them... That was the end."

### The "Open Ocean" Illusion

**Sato:** "Many at Sega believed that on PlayStation and Nintendo, our games would sell like crazy. What actually happened: we brought Virtua Fighter to market and Tekken was already there. Going into the open ocean, we discovered it was full of sharks."

---

# INTERVIEW 4: SEGA GAME DEVELOPMENT HISTORY AND CORPORATE CULTURE

## Part 1 (WP#19-01)

### Game Gear

The Game Gear used a 3.2" color LCD from Citizen at 19,800 yen. Six AA batteries lasted about 3 hours. Worldwide sales reached approximately 5 million units. Sato partnered with JAL to put Game Gear units on airplanes.

**Sato on meeting Bill Gates:** "Gates came to Japan and we discussed turning Game Gear into an information terminal. I was 30+ minutes late to the meeting because of traffic."

### AI Computer (1986)

An educational computer using the Prolog programming language -- about 2,000 units sold. A commercial failure, but its lessons led to the successful Kids Computer Pico.

### Kids Computer Pico

Built on the AI Computer's lessons: digitizer tablet, ROM storybooks, instant boot. Dominated the kindergarten market.

### Arcade System Boards

Sato established the system board philosophy inherited from Gremlin: SYSTEM I (1983), SYSTEM II, III, SYSTEM E (economy), SYSTEM 16, SYSTEM 24, SYSTEM 32.

### MODEL Series and Military Partnership

**Sato:** "We partnered with General Electric's military division for CG technology -- they made flight and tank simulators. GE shared older, declassified technology in exchange for development fees. This led to MODEL 2 with texture mapping."

GE sold to Martin Marietta; MODEL 3 was completed there.

### NVIDIA's Origin Story

**Sato:** "When NVIDIA was still really small -- maybe about 30 people -- I asked the founder, Jensen Huang, and we invested money to have them develop a graphics chip. But the project failed. However, when we invested that money, we negotiated for stock. From Sega, we had Yu Suzuki and others aggressively requesting specific capabilities. Jensen Huang absorbed what functions were necessary for games and imprinted all of it into his chips. The result was an excellent chip that got into PCs and became today's GeForce."

### Yu Suzuki

**Sato on Suzuki:** "Aggressive, intensely curious, capable, with a mathematics background. He volunteered for 3D CG work and became the flagship engineer for MODEL 1 and the Virtua series."

### Super Derby and Technical Innovation

The arcade medal game Super Derby used a free-track system with custom brushless motors from Nihon Servo, plus digitizer technology -- showcasing Sato's ability to forge partnerships with smaller companies excited by technically interesting challenges.

## Part 2 (WP#19-02)

### Copy Protection Wars

**Sato:** "I built numerous copy protection systems -- even custom microprocessors. Every time, pirates would crack them within two weeks. I'd get screamed at by the president."

"Once I got praised -- the new security chip was holding up. The president said, 'Looks like this one's good. Finally.' The next day: 'You idiot, it's been cracked!' The pirates found the security bit through binary search -- masking half the chip with UV-blocking material, erasing, checking if it still worked, halving again."

"But through all those failures, I was never demoted or had my pay cut. The president would yell, 'Get a buzzcut!' and the next day it was forgotten. That's the kind of culture the game industry needs."

### The TeraDrive/IBM Disaster

**Sato:** "The TeraDrive was a massive failure -- about 5-6 billion yen in contractual obligations to IBM. We contracted to buy 1 million copies of the DOS/V OS; we made about 1,000 units. The resolution was: 'We'll use IBM's POWER PC for the next system.'"

### Kura Sushi and Dreamcast Applications

Dreamcast hardware was used for Kura Sushi's ordering system, but failed because vinegar corroded the GD-ROM mechanisms. Surplus Dreamcast chips (about 1.5 million) were sold to Sammy for pachislot machines (Fist of the North Star).

### Saturn SDK Lessons Applied to Dreamcast

**Sato:** "Learning from Saturn's mistakes, we produced a very good SDK for Dreamcast. Skilled third parties could get images on screen in about three hours with the new kit. With Saturn, the same thing had taken about a week."

### Sega's "One and Done" Culture

**Sato:** "We gave good hints to others but couldn't turn anything into real products ourselves. The dot-eating game concept (Head On at Gremlin) preceded Pac-Man, but we didn't iterate or protect it. We were always chasing the next new thing."

### Risk-Taking and Decision-Making

**Sato:** "What the game industry needs is people who can make gut decisions and accept failure. In the old days, every game company had a strong-willed, autocratic leader. They'd say 'Do this!' Out of 10 bets, 7 would fail and 2-3 would hit. But decisions were made in a day."

"Today's Sega is all meetings. 'Is this profitable? Show me the competitor analysis.' By the time they're done, a year has passed. People are making PowerPoints instead of making games."

"Hit products are things that 9 out of 10 people oppose. Things everyone agrees on don't become hits."

### Why Japanese Games Conquered the World

**Sato:** "Within severe constraints -- limited semiconductor memory -- how do you delight players? That's something Japanese people are naturally good at. In a cramped space, finding just a little room. Packed trains, a small country -- the way of thinking, the environment you grow up in. When you need to create enjoyable experiences within limited capacity, you trim here, cut there, and maximize total performance."

"But now that memory is effectively unlimited, it's getting dangerous for Japan."

### Industry Decline and Changing Preferences

**Sato:** "The shift in how people spend time -- from arcades and consoles to smartphones and social communication -- is fundamental, not cyclical. The people who used to go to game centers now find it more interesting to interact with other humans online."
