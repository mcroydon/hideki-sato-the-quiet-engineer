## 1. Origins: Standard Games and Service Games (1940s-1950s)

### Standard Games (1940-1945)

In May 1940, American businessmen **Martin Bromley**, **Irving Bromberg**, and family friend **James Humpert** formed **Standard Games** in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide coin-operated amusement machines to American military bases. The onset of World War II and the consequent increase in military personnel created strong demand for leisure entertainment at bases.

In May 1945, Bromberg, Bromley, and Humpert established a second Hawaiian coin-op distributor called **California Games**, and they subsequently dissolved Standard Games that August. California Games was likewise terminated the following year.

### Service Games (1946-1960)

On **September 1, 1946**, the trio established **Service Games** to replace their earlier ventures, named for the military focus of their business.

After the **Johnson Act of 1951 prohibited the transportation of gambling devices to US territories and possessions**, Bromley sent employees **Richard Stewart** and **Ray LeMaire** to Tokyo to establish **Service Games of Japan** to provide coin-operated slot machines to US bases in Japan. On **February 15, 1952**, Service Games opened a distribution office in Tokyo, Japan.

A year later, all five men established **Service Games Panama** to control the entities of Service Games worldwide. The company expanded over the next seven years to include distribution in South Korea, the Philippines, and South Vietnam.

### Dissolution and Reconstitution

Due to notoriety arising from US government investigations into criminal business practices (later resolved in December 1964 with courts ruling there had been no criminal activity), **Service Games of Japan was dissolved on May 31, 1960**. On **June 3, 1960**, Bromley established two companies to take over its business activities: **Nihon Goraku Bussan** and **Nihon Kikai Seizo**.

[Source: David Rosen - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rosen_(businessman))

### The Merger that Created Sega Enterprises

### Periscope and Early Success

In **1966**, under Rosen's direction, Sega Enterprises created its first original game, **Periscope**, which became a worldwide hit and led to the introduction of 25-cent play in the United States, a significant price increase from the standard 10-cent play.

## 5. Key Leadership Timeline

### Hayao Nakayama (President/CEO 1984-1998)

**Hayao Nakayama** (born May 21, 1932) was the former President and CEO of Sega Enterprises, Ltd. from **1984 to 1998**. Nakayama began his career in the amusement industry as a **jukebox repair technician** before founding **Esco Trading Co.** (Esco Boueki), a coin-op distributor. Esco Boueki was acquired by Sega, bringing Nakayama into the company.
[Source: Hayao Nakayama - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Nakayama); [Source: Sonic Wiki Zone](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Hayao_Nakayama)

**Nakayama was the crucial figure who pushed Sega into the console market.** Following the arcade industry downturn in the early 1980s, Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise gained through years in the arcade industry to move into the home console market, which was in its infancy in Japan at the time.
[Source: Sega Genesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis); [Source: History of Sega - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sega)

Under Nakayama's leadership, Sega launched:
- **SG-1000** (1983) — Sega's first home console
- **Sega Master System** (1986)
- **Mega Drive / Genesis** (1988/1989) — achieved over 30 million units sold worldwide
- **Game Gear** (1990) — Sega's first handheld console
- **Sega Saturn** (1994)

Nakayama drove Sega's global expansion by formalizing **Sega of America as an autonomous subsidiary in 1986** and appointing **Tom Kalinske** as its president in 1990 to tailor strategies for Western markets.
[Source: Hayao Nakayama - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Nakayama)

**Resignation:** As a result of the company's deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in **January 1998** in favor of Shoichiro Irimajiri, and became vice-chairman of Sega's arcade division.
[Source: Hayao Nakayama - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Nakayama)

### Shoichiro Irimajiri (President 1998-2000)

**Shoichiro Irimajiri** became chairman and CEO of Sega of America in **1996**, and became president of Sega in **January 1998**. He was a former Honda executive. As president, he laid an ambitious plan using the Dreamcast to restore Sega's lost market share and prestige.
[Source: Shoichiro Irimajiri - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoichiro_Irimajiri); [Source: Reference for Business](https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/Ro-Sh/SEGA-Corporation.html)

Irimajiri oversaw the development of the Dreamcast, with Sega spending **US$50-80 million on hardware development**, **$150-200 million on software development**, and **US$300 million on worldwide promotion**.
[Source: Dreamcast - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast)

On **May 22, 2000**, Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega.
[Source: Shoichiro Irimajiri - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoichiro_Irimajiri)

### Isao Okawa (Chairman throughout; President 2000-2001)

**Isao Okawa** served as chairman of Sega from the 1984 buyout until his death. He became president in May 2000 after Irimajiri's departure. Okawa also served as head of CSK Corporation, Sega's parent company.
[Source: Isao Okawa - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Okawa); [Source: Reference for Business](https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/Ro-Sh/SEGA-Corporation.html)

## 7. The SOJ vs. SOA Dynamic

### Structural Tensions

Sega was in an unusual position in the early 1990s: while it was enjoying significant success in the West with the Genesis/Mega Drive, in Japan it was firmly in **third place behind Nintendo and NEC**. This dynamic created fundamental tensions between Sega of Japan (SOJ) and Sega of America (SOA).
[Source: ResetEra discussion](https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-anyone-elaborate-on-what-kickstarted-the-enmity-between-sega-of-japan-and-sega-of-america-during-the-genesis-era.131991/)

### Different Business Philosophies

SOA had a very different idea of how to build the Genesis brand, involving **aggressive marketing, selling the console at a loss, packing in the best game, and a show of aggression** — all of which SOJ was highly uncomfortable with.
[Source: ResetEra](https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-anyone-elaborate-on-what-kickstarted-the-enmity-between-sega-of-japan-and-sega-of-america-during-the-genesis-era.131991/)

### Trust Deficit

Despite the revenue SOA was generating, SOJ often did not defer to their knowledge of the American market. As one SOA executive described: **"They didn't trust us, and they didn't understand our market. So we would turn down titles, and they were insulted that we would turn down their side-scrolling shooting games. And at the upper levels, they really wanted us just to behave, to do what they wanted us to do, to be a carbon copy."**

### Self-Destructive Dynamic

Many colleagues at SOA attributed Sega's problems to **incompatible business practices between Japan and America** — perhaps rooted in jealousy by Sega of Japan executives over the success experienced by their American colleagues, ultimately leading to self-destruction.

Between 1989 and 1992, **the American subsidiary became the dominant arm of Sega Enterprises** in terms of revenue generation.

## 8. Tom Kalinske's Tenure at SOA (1990-1996)

### Background and Hiring

**Tom Kalinske** was recruited to be the president and CEO of Sega of America in **1990**, replacing **Michael Katz** (who had been the initial SOA CEO). Kalinske was previously a successful executive at Mattel and Matchbox. He was recruited by Hayao Nakayama.
[Source: Tom Kalinske - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kalinske); [Source: Sega-16 Interview](https://www.sega-16.com/2006/07/interview-tom-kalinske/)

### Marketing Revolution

Kalinske's aggressive marketing decisions were key elements in the success of the Sega Genesis:
- **Price drops** to undercut Nintendo
- **Anti-Nintendo attack ads** ("Genesis does what Nintendon't")
- The famous **"Sega Scream"** TV campaign
- Sega was the **first major company to advertise on MTV**
- Sponsoring rock concerts with Genesis displays set up outside entrances
- **Blockbuster partnership**: developed a strategic partnership with Blockbuster CEO to rent Sega hardware units, which increased retail sales of both hardware and software
- **$20 million "Sonic the Hedgehog 3" promotion in 1994** involving McDonald's, Betty Crocker, and LifeSavers partnerships

[Source: Tom Kalinske - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kalinske); [Source: FundingUniverse](https://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/sega-of-america-inc-history/)

### Revenue Growth

While Kalinske was CEO of Sega of America, the company grew from **$72 million to more than $1.5 billion** and the market value of Sega grew from **less than $2 billion to more than $5 billion**.
[Source: Tom Kalinske - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kalinske)

By late 1993, Sega captured **51% market share** for the six months preceding Christmas. By January 1992, Sega controlled **65 percent of the 16-bit console market**.
[Source: FundingUniverse](https://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/sega-of-america-inc-history/); [Source: Sega - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega)

### Conflicts with SOJ

Kalinske's success was undermined by growing conflicts with Sega of Japan. The Saturn surprise launch (see Section 9) was emblematic of SOJ overriding SOA's judgment about the American market. Kalinske **departed Sega in 1996**, frustrated by SOJ's decisions regarding the Saturn.

## 9. Major Corporate Decisions and Turning Points

### Entering the Console Market (1983)

Sega released the **SG-1000** on **July 15, 1983** — the same day that Nintendo released the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan. The decision was driven by Nakayama, who saw the arcade downturn as a reason to diversify into home consoles. The SG-1000 console series (including the Mark III) sold over **1.4 million units** in Japan as of 1988.
[Source: SG-1000 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000)

The Mark III (1985) was engineered by the same team as the SG-1000, including **Hideki Sato** and **Masami Ishikawa**, who later led development of the Mega Drive.
[Source: Master System - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System)

### The Genesis Push in America (1989-1994)

The Genesis launched in Japan on **October 29, 1988** (¥21,000), and in North America in **August 1989** with a **$10 million promotional blitz** including MTV commercials. The launch price was **$189.99**.
[Source: FundingUniverse](https://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/sega-of-america-inc-history/); [Source: Sega Genesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis)

The Genesis became Sega's most successful console, selling **30.75 million units worldwide**. In the US, Sega claimed **55% of all 16-bit hardware sales during 1994**.
[Source: Sega - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega); [Source: Sega Genesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis)

### The 32X Debacle (1994)

During the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, SOA R&D head Joe Miller received a phone call from Nakayama stressing the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Atari Jaguar. Codenamed **"Project Mars"**, the 32X was designed as a transitional add-on for the Genesis into the 32-bit era.

The 32X put **Sega into competition with itself** once the Saturn rolled out. Because the machines shared many parts and were preparing to launch around the same time, tensions between SOA and SOJ intensified. The 32X sold approximately **665,000 units worldwide** during its brief lifespan — a commercial failure.
[Source: 32X - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32X)

### The Saturn Surprise Launch (1995)

At E3 1995 (the first Electronic Entertainment Expo, May 11-13, 1995), SOA CEO Tom Kalinske revealed that the Saturn would be available **immediately** at select retailers at a price of **$399**, with 30,000 units already shipped. The original launch date had been September 2, 1995, but **SOJ mandated an early launch** to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation.

The surprise announcement **upset retailers** who were not informed, including Best Buy and Walmart. **KB Toys responded by refusing to carry the Saturn and its games.** The Saturn launched with no completed games available and limited to just four retail chains.
[Source: Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91363906/sega-surprise-saturn-launch-backfired-changed-gaming-forever); [Source: SegaBits](https://segabits.com/blog/2011/05/28/saturn-month-segas-big-e3-saturn-surprise-debacle/)

The Saturn sold **9.26 million units worldwide** (5.75 million in Japan, 1.8 million in the US, 1 million in Europe, 530,000 elsewhere) — considered a commercial failure, especially in the West.
[Source: Sega Saturn - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn)

### Bernie Stolar's Role (1996-1999)

**Bernie Stolar** (October 9, 1946 – June 22, 2022) was recruited as president and COO of Sega of America after Kalinske's departure in 1996. Stolar had previously been instrumental in launching the **PlayStation** at Sony.

Stolar's most famous statement upon joining Sega: **"We have to kill the Saturn."** He determined the Saturn was dead in the US and focused on keeping the company afloat while preparing for the Dreamcast. His controversial stance included limiting Saturn software releases in the US.
[Source: Bernie Stolar - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Stolar); [Source: Never Ending Realm](https://neverendingrealm.com/opinion/bernie-stolar-the-legend-the-no-rpg-policy-and-his-dreamcast-love/)

Stolar's most celebrated moment came when he announced the **Dreamcast would be priced at $199** to a standing ovation. However, prior to the Dreamcast's North American launch, Stolar was let go and received a **$5 million severance package**.
[Source: Bernie Stolar - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Stolar)

### Dreamcast Development (1997-1998)

Considering the Saturn's poor performance, Irimajiri looked beyond Sega's internal hardware development division. In **1997**, he enlisted IBM's **Tatsuo Yamamoto** to lead an eleven-person team on a secret project codenamed **"Blackbelt"** in the United States.

Simultaneously, an internal team led by **Hideki Sato** also began development on Dreamcast hardware. Accounts vary: one suggests Sega tasked both teams; another suggests that **Sato was bothered by Irimajiri's choice to begin development externally** and had his team start work independently.
[Source: Dreamcast - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast)

Sega spent **US$50-80 million on hardware development**, **$150-200 million on software development**, and **US$300 million on worldwide promotion** for the Dreamcast.
[Source: Dreamcast - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast)

The Dreamcast launched in Japan on **November 27, 1998** and in North America on **September 9, 1999**. It sold **10.6 million units worldwide** (5.43 million in the US, 2.86 million in Asia, 1.79 million in Europe).
[Source: Dreamcast - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast)

### Exiting Hardware (2001)

On **January 31, 2001**, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a **"platform-agnostic" third-party developer**.

## 10. Financial Trajectory

### Peak Revenue (1992-1994)

- **FY1991**: Revenue crossed ¥100 billion for the first time
- **FY1992**: Revenue more than doubled to **¥213 billion**
- **FY1993**: Revenue reached **¥347 billion** (surpassing Nakayama's ¥320 billion goal)
- **April-September 1993**: Peak six-month period at **¥200,645 million** (~$2 billion USD)
- **FY1994 peak**: Revenue reached approximately **¥354 billion ($3.46 billion)**, the highest in Sega's history

In April 1992, Nakayama announced: **"We're going to implement a five-year plan to become a ¥600 billion revenue business."**
[Source: Mega Drive Shock financial analysis](https://mdshock.com/2021/04/14/segas-financial-troubles-an-analysis-of-export-revenue-1991-1998/)

### The Decline Begins (Late 1993)

The financial downturn began in **late 1993** — earlier than the commonly believed 1995 start. In FY1994's second half, consumer export revenue dropped to **62% of the first half** (H1: ¥130 billion; H2: ¥80 billion) during what should have been the profitable holiday season.
[Source: Mega Drive Shock](https://mdshock.com/2021/04/14/segas-financial-troubles-an-analysis-of-export-revenue-1991-1998/)

Root causes identified by Nakayama:
1. Worsening economic environment in Japan and Europe
2. Yen appreciation (gained ~10% in 1993; continued strengthening through 1995)
3. Arcade and home console markets entering "off-season"

Exchange rate deterioration:
- 1992: $1 = ¥127
- 1993: $1 = ¥111
- 1994: $1 = ¥102
- 1995: $1 = ¥94

### Saturn/Dreamcast Era Losses

- **FY1998 (ending March 31, 1998)**: Sega suffered its first consolidated financial losses since its 1988 Tokyo Stock Exchange listing — a consolidated net loss of **¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million)**
- **FY1999**: Additional **¥42.881 billion** consolidated net loss; plans to eliminate **1,000 jobs**, nearly a quarter of its workforce
- **FY1999**: Lost **$412 million**; sales declined 12% to **$2.2 billion**
- **FY2000**: Lost **$398 million**
- **FY2001**: Extraordinary losses of **$689 million** from ending Dreamcast production
- **FY2002**: Revenue fell to **half of decade-prior levels**

### Recovery

- **FY2003**: First annual profit in six years
- **FY2004**: Sales reached **$1.81 billion**

## 11. Isao Okawa's Personal Financial Sacrifice

Isao Okawa's financial commitment to Sega was extraordinary and deeply personal:

- In **1984**, Okawa's CSK Corporation stepped in and acquired a controlling interest in Sega when the company teetered on the edge after the North American video game crash
- Okawa provided over **US$40 million** towards Sega, mainly to fund the Dreamcast
- In the **summer of 1999**, Okawa loaned Sega **$500 million** personally
- Shortly before his death, Okawa **forgave all of Sega's debts to him**
- He donated his **entire personal stake in the company** — including shares in Sega, CSK, Ascii, and NextCom — totaling **¥85 billion ($695.7 million)** at the time
- Okawa died of **heart failure on March 16, 2001**

As a result of his generosity, Okawa is remembered as having quite literally saved Sega from bankruptcy, allowing them to survive the transition to a software-only company.

## 12. The Sammy Corporation Acquisition (2003-2004)

### Initial Merger Attempt (2003)
