## Section 7: Transfer to Hachioji Municipal Seventh Middle School

**Q:** Now let's begin the second half. When you came from Hokkaido to Hachioji in Tokyo, were you anxious?

**Sato:** "Maybe I'm just thick-skinned, but I didn't feel any particular anxiety. Maybe it was because of all those transfers (laughs)."

**Q:** You were used to transferring by then.

**Sato:** "Maybe so. I entered the Seventh Middle School in Hachioji -- the Seventh -- because it was right next to Kobiki-cho where we lived. When I did my self-introduction -- I think it was winter, October, November, maybe later, maybe even after the new year -- I said, 'It's warm here.' For people in Tokyo it was freezing cold, but I said it was warm. Everyone went, 'Huh?!'"

**Sato:** "In Hokkaido, going to the toilet and pulling down your pants was brutally cold. Sometimes we'd keep a fire going all night. What did we burn? Since my father worked at a sawmill, we had wood scraps and sawdust. There was a big tank with a stove underneath, and the sawdust would burn slowly, keeping the fire going all day long. But once you went into the toilet, it was freezing. There was this special kind of underwear that had a flap at the back -- when you squatted, it would open up so you didn't have to pull your pants down."

**Q:** You didn't have to take off your underwear?

**Sato:** "That's right -- you could do your business while staying warm."

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "That's how cold it was. Thermal underwear, top and bottom, for warmth. So coming to Tokyo and saying 'it's warm here' -- the Tokyo kids thought I was crazy."

**Sato:** "After entering school, as I said, one or two kids started talking to me. One of them gave me a quiz: 'Write "north" and "capital" -- how do you read it?' I said 'Pekin' [Beijing]. 'Write "south" and "capital" -- how do you read it?' 'Nankin' [Nanjing]. 'Now write "east" and "capital" -- how do you read it?' And I said 'Toukin'? No, it's 'Tokyo' (laughs). They were like, 'What's wrong with you, that wasn't even funny.'"

**Sato:** "Because of my Hokkaido dialect, some words caused confusion. In Hokkaido, to swap or trade something, we say 'bakuru.' So when I said 'let's bakuru this and that,' everyone went, 'What does that mean?' Also, locking a door is 'joppin karu,' and when you're tired, you say 'kowai' [which in standard Japanese means 'scary']. People would be baffled."

**Sato:** "A few kids gave me the nickname 'Tagosaku' -- meaning 'country bumpkin.' But it wasn't particularly unpleasant."

**Sato:** "There was a cute girl living in the same housing complex, in a different building. Petite, dark-haired, adorable -- quite popular. Through some rotation of seats, I ended up sitting next to her. And back then there was a thing called 'nicchoku' -- class duty, where two students stay after school."

**Q:** Yes, that still exists.

**Sato:** "So the two of us were left alone -- a boy and a girl from the same row. Since she was cute, she had lots of admirers. I didn't think much of it -- I mean, I thought she was cute, but it wasn't a big deal. Some boys called me out and gave me a hard time (laughs). They didn't punch my face, but someone hit me in the stomach. It didn't really hurt, but I played it up -- 'ow, ow, ow' -- and got through it. Actually, I ran into that girl when I was about 20. We went out for drinks, ended up at a late-night coffee shop, and then said goodbye. What a waste."

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "I was so naive back then. I was at a junior college, sharing a 4.5-mat room with another guy. If I'd been living alone... my life might have turned out differently (laughs)."

## Section 8: High School -- Fujimori and Hino

**Sato:** "After middle school, I took the entrance exam for Fujimori High School in Hachioji. The top schools in the area were Tachikawa High School and Kunitachi High School or Musashi -- I didn't have the brains for any of them. So I took the exam for Fujimori High School and failed."

**Sato:** "It happened that Hino High School was just opening as a newly established school and was recruiting. After failing Fujimori, I ended up going to Hino High School. It's near Takahata Fudo. Since it was brand new, there was no actual school building. We spent the first year in prefab buildings."

**Q:** Tokyo Metropolitan Hino High School?

**Sato:** "That's right, Metropolitan Hino High School. From the start, as with the junior college later, we had no money (laughs). We were always poor. A private school was totally out of the question. It had to be public -- metropolitan schools only. Back then you could list a first, second, and third choice. I think the teacher put Hino as my second choice. I was in the first graduating class. Apparently some celebrity went there too, later."

---

## Section 9: Middle and High School Life

**Q:** What was your middle school life like?

**Sato:** "Middle school... what did I do? There was a kid named Oka whose family ran a Buddhist temple. I used to go to his place a lot. His older brother rode a 750cc motorcycle -- he might have been a gang leader. Honda's 750 was groundbreaking at the time. I'd hang out there. Other than that, I don't have many memories."

**Q:** Were you in any clubs -- a physics club, or anything involving tinkering with machines?

**Sato:** "That was high school. In high school I joined the physics club."

**Q:** Really?

**Sato:** "We made a crappy lie detector and things like that. Put up a booth at the school festival."

**Q:** What magazines or manga were you reading?

**Sato:** "Starting in middle school or maybe high school, I suddenly became a big reader. As I mentioned, I read the classics. Starting from Tolstoy, then Dickens, and on and on. I remember writing in some essay: 'Confused by Kafka, elated by Dickens,' or something like that. I read a lot."

**Sato:** "One specific book: I think it was Solzhenitsyn, or maybe Thomas Mann's 'The Magic Mountain.' There was a passage about absolute time and relative time. When you have memories -- whether of hardship or joy, especially joy -- time seems to fly by. But five, ten, twenty years later, those memories remain, and the time associated with them remains. If you spend your time doing nothing, there are no memories, and that time effectively disappears. So even if absolute time is the same, the relative time perceived later is completely different. I think it was set in a tuberculosis isolation ward. That passage has stayed with me vividly to this day. But I've forgotten the entire plot."

**Sato:** "For Japanese authors: starting with Hoshi Shinichi, then moving on. The way I read was -- if I found one author interesting, I'd read everything by that person. Endo Shusaku, Takahashi Kazumi -- just binge through one author, then move to the next. I read lots and lots of books. But I've forgotten most of them. I don't know if any of it was nourishing (laughs)."

**Q:** What prompted you to start reading in middle and high school?

**Sato:** "Probably because of entrance exams. I figured I should read a bit for the 'Japanese' portion of the tests. That was likely the trigger."

**Sato:** "Early in middle school I couldn't study at all. But when entrance exams approached, I started working harder. I went from near the bottom all the way up -- enough that they said I could try for Fujimori High School. Though I ended up failing."

**Sato:** "I need some kind of catalyst. Without it, I'm hopeless -- too lazy. Give me a trigger and I'll push hard. But I'm not the type for daily diligence. I'm more of a play-it-by-ear person. I've never set life goals. My motto? 'Nothing ventured, nothing gained.' Or more like 'Worth a shot even if it fails.'"

**Sato:** "My blood type is A. When I tell people, they say there's no way. I think A types are sloppy -- at least I am. My father was O and my mother was A, so I'm AO. Maybe my strange qualities come from my father. Like I said, if my father felt he'd been lied to by an employer, he wouldn't even greet the boss in the morning. Just walk right past without a word. Normally you'd at least say 'good morning' even if you hated the person. But he wouldn't. That would obviously sour the relationship, and things would fall apart. Then he'd move on. If he'd just said 'good morning,' maybe I wouldn't have had to transfer so many times."

**Sato:** "But at the same time, I can't do that myself. Even with a boss I dislike, I'd say 'good morning.' So the fact that my father could just ignore someone like that -- part of me thinks 'that takes guts' (laughs), but another part thinks 'that's just stupid.' It's contradictory."

**Sato:** "At Hino High School, the second year we got the new building. In the first year, the homeroom teacher was a man named Nomura, I think. He taught physics, which is probably why I joined the physics club, though what we did was really just playing around."

**Sato:** "In the second year, we had a female teacher. Normally, as I've said, I get along well with female teachers -- praise me and I flourish. But this teacher didn't praise me at all. What was popular at school was table tennis -- but not with proper paddles. We used blackboard erasers on the back side, pushed all the desks together, used something as a net. It was fun."

**Sato:** "After school we'd keep playing for a while. After this went on for several days, the female teacher concluded that I didn't want to go home. She thought something must be wrong at home. She called my parents in for a meeting (laughs). My mother told me about it later. I was just having fun with friends -- nothing more. But the teacher read more into it, which created friction between us. If she'd been the type to say 'Hideki-chan, Hideki-chan' and boost me up, I would have thrived. Instead, things got awkward for that whole second year."

## Section 10: University Entrance Exams -- Tokyo Metropolitan College of Technology

**Sato:** "In the third year, another male teacher, and it was time for university exams. The school separated us into science/math and liberal arts tracks. I wanted to go into science and engineering -- I was interested in making things. Since it was a new school, they had targets for how many students should get into national and public universities."

**Sato:** "I studied reasonably hard. Back then there was a first-round and second-round system. I sat for Chiba University in the first round and Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in the second round."

**Q:** The one in Fuchu?

**Sato:** "Yes, in Fuchu. I failed both spectacularly (laughs). I'd studied, but it's not like I had a private tutor -- we couldn't afford that. I had to do it on my own."

**Sato:** "I had no choice but to go to prep school, so I asked my father and enrolled in Shinjuku Prep School. They gave an entrance test and did class placements. I thought I'd spend a year there. But the cost was considerable. My father then suggested a metropolitan junior college -- the Tokyo Metropolitan College of Industrial Technology, which used to be in Samezu. It's now become a four-year university in Toyota. He said, 'Why don't you try there?'"

**Sato:** "From his perspective, if he could get me into any national/public school, the costs would be manageable. So I applied, thinking I'd go there while studying to retake exams for a four-year university the next year."

**Sato:** "I got in. The level wasn't too high, and my scores were apparently decent. I applied for a scholarship -- I'd been on one in high school too. Our family income easily qualified (laughs). At the junior college, the scholarship was 5,000 yen per month. That covered tuition and everything with spending money left over. Tuition was maybe 2,000 yen for a public college."

**Sato:** "I'd intended to use the junior college as a stepping stone. But once you're actually enrolled, with the curriculum and making friends... the motivation to study for another entrance exam just evaporates. The curriculum was actually incredibly demanding -- around 140 credits, because the school was trying to qualify as a four-year institution. Way more than a normal junior college."

**Sato:** "So I just went with the flow -- played mahjong, goofed around, went to Totsuka Women's Junior College to meet girls."

**Sato:** [He tells a story about going to the Totsuka Women's College festival with two or three friends, setting up a fortune-telling booth where he pretended to read girls' futures using 10-yen coins. He would chat with each girl, read her personality from the conversation, and then dispense advice. His female friends watching thought he looked cool doing it. He started dating one of them, though she eventually dumped him.]

## Section 11: The Junior College -- Plans for the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV)

**Q:** To confirm -- the Samezu location of the metropolitan junior college, that's near Haneda, on the Keikyu line?

**Sato:** "That's right."

**Sato:** "By the time the two years were up, I wasn't thinking about getting a job at all. The reason was that someone living near my apartment had gone to America for two or three years with the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers, and I'd heard his stories. In America, you could get a driver's license with just a written test -- very easily. You could bring it back and convert it to a Japanese license. Not just a regular car license, but for large vehicles and trucks too. Plus you'd get to enjoy American life, on a government-sponsored program."

**Sato:** "At the junior college I'd joined the ESS -- English Speaking Society. I wanted to communicate with foreigners. We'd stay at youth hostels where foreign travelers would be. I met three girls from Canada there -- they were cute. We showed them around Tokyo a bit. The word that stuck with me from that experience was 'cooler.' I tried to say we didn't have a 'cooler' at home, but the word didn't communicate. Cool, cooler, coolest -- the English didn't work like that. That experience made me want to join the Overseas Cooperation Volunteers and go to America."

**Sato:** "The volunteer position happened to be for farming. I'd never farmed in my life. The Saitama prefecture office was recruiting, so I moved my registered address to a friend's place in Saitama and applied. The written test was easy -- I'm sure I passed. The English conversation portion went fine too. But then came the interview."

**Sato:** "In the interview, when asked how the test was, I decided to speak my mind forcefully. I told them the test questions were ridiculous -- things like 'spell cabbage.' For a farming program, sure, maybe that makes sense. But I was an electrical engineering student. This aggressive approach was my first mistake."

**Sato:** "Then they asked: if you're doing a homestay and disagree with your host, what would you do? I said I'd debate them thoroughly, stand my ground. I thought that was the 'right' answer. In hindsight, I should have said I'd listen respectfully to their views. But I was inexperienced."

**Sato:** "After waiting and waiting with no response, I called them. They said I'd failed. I was stunned -- I'd been confident. They hinted the interview was the problem."

**Sato:** "Frustrated, I tried the Tokyo metropolitan government's program. But when the official asked about my current work, I claimed to be working at a pear orchard -- I'd arranged with a friend named Matsumura to cover for me. When the official asked how big the orchard was, I couldn't answer. He asked how many ares it was. I didn't know, so I stood up and gestured, 'About that big.' Obviously, that wasn't going to fly. Tokyo rejected me too."

---

## Section 12: Deciding to Get a Job

**Sato:** "Meanwhile, I'd meet up with junior college friends, and they'd all be talking about their new jobs. 'I'm going to Trio.' 'I'm going to Fujitsu.' 'Casio.' Since we were electrical engineering graduates, it was all electronics companies. I thought, 'Wait, everyone's getting jobs?' Which is obvious, but it hadn't occurred to me."

**Sato:** "So I went to the school. This was around March 25th or 26th. I told the placement teacher I wanted a job. He said, 'You told me you weren't looking for work!' That was because I'd been planning on the Overseas Volunteers. The teacher grudgingly suggested Fujisoku -- a company that makes switches and outlets. He said he could pull strings there."

**Sato:** "But I said to him: 'A switch that goes click and electricity flows? A plug you stick in and current passes through? Sensei, that's boring.' He got angry. 'You come to me this late, I'm offering you the one place where I have connections, and you say it's boring? Fine. Go upstairs to the career resource room and look for yourself.' I'd never been to that room. So I went."

**Sato:** "Looking through the materials, I found Tomy -- the toy company. They had all these toys, and I wasn't averse to plastic models. I thought, 'Tomy looks interesting. Better than switches and outlets.' So I called them. They said recruiting was closed. It was still March! I'd never done any job hunting, so I had no idea. I was outraged -- 'It's not even April yet and you're closed?'"

**Sato:** [Years later, he told this story to Tomy's president, Mr. Toyama. Toyama was surprised, assumed it was earlier in the year, and apologized. When Sato clarified it was late March, Toyama said, "Well, yeah, that's too late."]

---

## Section 13: Walking into Sega

**Sato:** "Tomy was closed, so I kept looking. That's when I found Sega. I opened the company brochure. They weren't making toys, but they had slot machines, early arcade game machines, and jukeboxes. And -- Fridays were half-days, weekends off. Because it was a foreign-owned company."

**Sato:** "The starting salary was about 32,000 yen -- not bad at all. The location was Otorii [on the Keikyu line]. I was based in Samezu. From Samezu to Otorii, you transfer at Kamata and it's two stops -- very close. I figured if I called, they'd probably say recruiting was closed. So I decided to just go there in person. I went to Sega that same day."

**Sato:** "This is where my luck kicked in. First: by late March, the HR department has nothing to do. The entrance ceremony is all that's left to prepare. Recruiting is finished. They're in a lull. And into this lull walks one idiot. I asked to see someone from HR."

**Sato:** "The HR section chief happened to be a graduate of Tokyo Metropolitan University -- same metropolitan system as my school. Maybe because he was bored, or maybe because of the metropolitan connection, he met with me. I introduced myself: 'I'm Sato, from the metropolitan junior college, and I'd like a job.' Then I had the nerve to say, 'Could you show me around the company?'"

**Sato:** "And he did -- probably because he had nothing better to do. He showed me everything. The factory where they were assembling game machines. The repair department. The sales division. The jukebox operation -- Sega was dominant in jukeboxes at the time. All sorts of famous singers would come to get their records included. While we were walking through, Fuji Keiko -- the singer who later committed suicide -- walked past and gave a little bow. Major recording artists would come because having their new songs in Sega's jukeboxes was huge promotion. He showed me a room with over 100,000 records."

**Sato:** "He showed me the development department and the production engineering department. The development section had a workshop on one side and a researcher's room on the other -- locked with some kind of keypad. I couldn't go inside there. But I saw the workshop area and the production engineering department, plus the factory. After the tour, he asked what I thought."

**Sato:** "I said, 'I'd be willing to join if it's the development department or the production engineering department' (laughs). 'I don't want to be on the factory floor tightening screws.' Then came the second stroke of luck: the development department had planned to hire three people, but only two had come. Since nobody knew Sega, they couldn't attract applicants, and there was one vacancy. He said, 'If you're interested in development, go talk to them.'"

**Sato:** "So I got an impromptu interview with the development department head and deputy head. We talked about various things -- they brought up lasers or something, I bluffed my way through. Then they said, 'Sato, if you join, you won't start in development right away. You'll be doing manual work first -- bending sheet metal, drilling holes, cutting and shaping wood.' I said, 'That's not a problem at all. I like that kind of work. I've always loved plastic models.' We talked for maybe 15 minutes, then they sent me back to HR."

**Sato:** "The department head was a wonderful person. He might have been my third stroke of luck. I eventually asked him to be the go-between at my wedding (laughs). When I got back to HR, they'd already received word. With the vacancy and the positive interview, I was hired."

**Sato:** "The HR chief asked if I'd brought any documents. No. Transcripts? No. Health checkup? No."

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "He told me to get everything ready quickly. I went back to school the next day for transcripts. The health checkup required an appointment at a public health center. All the paperwork wasn't complete until after April. I never took an entrance examination."

**Sato:** "It was all verbal -- just talking and bluffing (laughs) and sheer luck that got me into Sega. Later, when Sega became famous through consumer games and advertising, they'd get tens of thousands of applicants. Thousands would come to company information sessions. They'd do cutoff exams. I would never have gotten in through that process -- absolutely impossible (laughs)."

---

## Section 14: Entering Sega as a Developer

**Sato:** "The entrance ceremony was on April 1st at the Haneda Tokyu Hotel -- it's been demolished now. I went to the reception desk and saw 'University Graduates This Way.' I didn't know the word 'gakusotusha' [graduate hires]. The receptionist directed me. That's when I learned 'gakusotusha' means someone who graduated from school."

**Sato:** "There were about 150 new hires. Three for development, four or five for production engineering. The rest were game center staff, sales people, and administrative positions. I still have the group photo from that day. Of course, not everyone's around anymore. After 10 years, probably half were gone. After 20 years, another half. By the time I left Sega in 2008, almost no one from my cohort remained -- maybe one or two."

**Sato:** "I moved to an apartment closer to work. I'd been commuting from my parents' housing complex in Musashimurayama -- taking a motorbike to Tamagawa-Josui Station, then the Seibu Shinjuku Line to Takadanobaba, then the Yamanote Line to Shinagawa, then the Keikyu Line, then transfer again for the airport line to Otorii. Leaving home at 6:40 in the morning, barely making it by 8:30. The return trip took over two hours."

**Sato:** "After about half a year of this during my student days, I couldn't take it anymore. A guy named Fukushima from the junior college had an apartment in Zoshiki [near Haneda on the Keikyu line]. A crummy place -- no flush toilet, no bath -- but a 4.5-mat room. I offered to pay half the rent to live with him."

**Sato:** "He was very tidy. Every morning he'd fold his futon and put it in the closet. Since he did it, I felt obligated to do the same -- even though I'd rather leave it out. And he cleaned every day. He was fastidious, which was lucky for me. But if he hadn't been there, maybe I would have... well, things with that girl might have gone differently (laughs)."

**Sato:** "I lived with him for about a year and a half. We were in completely different social circles, though -- he was in the serious group, and I was in the lazy, self-indulgent group. When he eventually moved out, I kept the apartment. Then I upgraded from 4.5 mats to a 6-mat room. Then that building was demolished, so I moved to another apartment nearby. Then Nishi-Rokugou, then after getting married we moved to Minami-Rokugou, then Naka-Rokugou. When my second daughter was born, the 72-square-meter apartment wasn't enough, so we bought a house in Kugahara, still in Ota Ward -- close enough for the weekly 8 AM meetings at the Otorii office."

**Sato:** "So the story of how I ended up at Sega -- there's really nothing more to it. It was a company nobody knew, with no appeal. Nobody recognized the Sega name on arcade machines -- players only cared whether a game was fun, not who made it. Taitou, Namco, Sega -- it was all the same to them."

**Sato:** "Games cost 10 or 20 or 30 yen back then. Some machines used a projector shining light through a spinning disc with painted images projected onto a screen -- that was a 'large-scale game.' Shooting gallery guns where pulling the trigger made a target fall because a string was released. Medal games with simple pushers. Slot machines, jukeboxes. Nobody in the general public knew Sega. That's why there were few applicants, vacancies, and I slotted right in."

**Sato:** "But for me, drilling holes and cutting wood wasn't disagreeable -- I actually enjoyed it, and those skills still serve me today. For example, when a drill bit gets dull, you sharpen it. Kind of like my father's saw work."

---

## Section 15: Early Work -- Learning to Prioritize

**Sato:** "The company was organized with researchers on one side and workers on the other. A researcher would decide to make a game, draw blueprints, and bring them to our section. 'Make this.' My supervisor would look at it and say, 'Sato, you look free -- here, do this.' I'd follow the blueprints -- bend what needs bending, drill what needs drilling -- bring it back. He'd check the dimensions with calipers, and if it was good, I'd deliver it to the researcher."

**Sato:** "One day, a researcher handed me a drawing directly and asked me to make something. I asked him, 'What's the most important part of this?' He explained: a bracket attaches to a chain, a model car sits on the bracket, the chain turns so the car comes around -- like a track. The chain pitch is fixed and critical. But the width of the bracket? 'Two or three millimeters off is fine -- it's just holding a model.' Same for other dimensions -- plenty of clearance."

**Sato:** "So I went back to my supervisor and said I'd picked up a job. He told me to make it. For the critical dimension -- the chain attachment -- I was precise. For everything else, I just eyeballed it. Didn't bother with careful scribing. The result? Fast. My supervisor was surprised: 'You're fast.' Of course I was -- I was cutting corners."

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "I focused only on the one critical dimension. Everything else got rough cuts. When my supervisor checked it against the blueprints, he found dimensions off -- '10.5 centimeters when it should be 10' -- and wanted me to redo it. I said, 'No, it's fine. He told me so.' The supervisor didn't believe me and went to check with the researcher. The researcher confirmed -- 'Of course those parts don't matter.'"

**Sato:** "From then on, my supervisor was both a little annoyed and quite impressed. He took a real liking to me. This led to being sent on a big project -- building an enormous diorama in the Kintetsu Building in Osaka. Model cars and trains running on tracks, where customers could pay 50 yen to drive a racing car or operate a train. Over 100 tsubo [330+ square meters], with mountains, tunnels, tracks. Since I'd been specially designated for this kind of mechanical work -- even though I was supposed to be the electrical guy (laughs) -- I was picked by name: 'Sato, you're coming.' I spent about three to six months in Osaka on that project."

**Sato:** "But it was doomed from the start. Who'd pay 50 yen to drive an HO-gauge model? And the trains kept having contact issues on the rails. Clean tracks were fine, but inside tunnels? Impossible to maintain. When one slow player would block the track, everyone behind would get stuck. It wasn't fun. After about six months, it was demolished."

**Sato:** [He tells a story about train-fare fraud during this Osaka posting. Workers were given Shinkansen ticket books for bimonthly trips home. A coworker showed him how to ride without getting the ticket punched -- duck into the buffet car when the conductor comes, then pick up a discarded local-line ticket at Tokyo Station to exit, paying only the small local fare. The unused Shinkansen tickets would accumulate and could be sold at ticket resellers. The coworker bragged about buying a camera with the proceeds. Sato admits doing this twice himself.]

## Section 16: Pinball Development

**Q:** At the time you joined, did your colleagues at Sega frequently talk about arcade games or game centers in their free time? Were people who joined interested in games?

**Sato:** "Probably hardly at all. But what I found most interesting was when I was assigned to design and develop pinball machines -- what Sega called 'flippers.' The company reorganized from the researcher-versus-worker structure into unified sections. Each section had both researchers and workers. I was assigned to the pinball section."

**Sato:** "Back then, all the control was done with relays -- electromagnetic relays. When current flows, the relay clicks and contacts close or open. The relay circuits were very logical. Once you understood them, they were straightforward. The timing was controlled by a motor turning cams -- about ten different cam types. When triggered, the motor would spin, and each cam would actuate at its designated timing to process different events."

**Sato:** "We'd build prototypes before handing designs to production engineering. With all the switches and electrically-driven components, you'd end up with 200 to 300 cables."

**Q:** I've done a bit of pinball maintenance myself -- there are so many parts, it's extremely complex.

**Sato:** "When wiring the prototype, say you have 100 cables. Maybe 10 different colors. Sega even added spiral-printed markings on the cables -- red and blue, green and white. But still, you'd end up with three or five cables of the same color. You're supposed to test which wire goes where with a multimeter. But our section was just three people. When three same-colored wires came out together, we'd bet on which was which (laughs). The section chief picks one, the subsection chief picks one, I pick one. Win and you get 10 yen. Work became fun. We'd collect the winnings and use them for lunch."

**Sato:** "Then, once the machine was running, we had to play-test it. But just playing is boring, so we'd bet on scores too. The highest scorer wins -- 10 yen per point position. We'd also bet on the 'oicho-kabu' [a card game style sum] of the score digits, and on 'number match' -- if the last digit of your score matched a randomly spinning number, you'd win a bonus replay."

**Sato:** "It wasn't just us three. We'd invite others to play too -- after all, you can't really evaluate the machine without lots of people playing. We'd get seven or eight people. With eight players, a win could net you 70 or 80 yen. If you hit kabu [a lucky number], even more. Serious money was moving around, even at 10 yen per bet."

**Sato:** "The play-testing was genuinely useful. If a target was too hard to hit, or too easy, the game wasn't fun. We'd make adjustments: 'Move this target a little to the left,' 'This one's almost impossible to reach.' When real money was at stake, people played with incredible focus and gave genuinely useful feedback. We made truly good products that way."

**Sato:** "Of course, the department head knew exactly what we were doing -- 'Those guys are gambling again.' He'd occasionally scold us: 'Enough already!' But he let it go."

**Q:** Was that the department head mentioned in this book? Ochi?

**Sato:** "Ochi-san was above the department head. The development department head was Takahashi-san. Above him was Ochi-san -- an unusual person. He was color-blind, but he'd draw his own artwork. He must have memorized which colors corresponded to what he saw. And he was an incredible idea man."

**Sato:** "Ochi-san brought in the trackball -- originally a military device. A ball that you roll to register horizontal and vertical movement. Like the trackball in a modern mouse. He made it bigger, put it in a game cabinet, and patented it. The patent was licensed to Namco and others. He had that kind of technical vision and inventiveness. His full name was Ochi Shikanosuke."

**Q:** We'd love to hear more about the development work in our next session. Thank you so much for today.

**Sato:** "Not at all."
