## Game Gear

The Game Gear used a 3.2-inch color LCD sourced from Citizen, priced at 19,800 yen. It was powered by six AA batteries, which lasted approximately 3 hours. Worldwide sales reached approximately 5 million units. Sato partnered with JAL (Japan Airlines) to place Game Gear units on airplanes for in-flight entertainment.

**Sato on meeting Bill Gates:** "Gates came to Japan and we discussed turning Game Gear into an information terminal. I was 30+ minutes late to the meeting because of traffic."

## AI Computer (1986)

The AI Computer was an educational computer that used the Prolog programming language. About 2,000 units were sold. It was a commercial failure, but the lessons learned from the project led directly to the successful Kids Computer Pico.

## Kids Computer Pico

Built on the AI Computer's lessons, the Kids Computer Pico featured a digitizer tablet, ROM storybooks, and instant boot capability. It dominated the kindergarten market.

## Arcade System Boards

Sato established the system board philosophy he had inherited from Gremlin Industries: SYSTEM I (1983), SYSTEM II, SYSTEM III, SYSTEM E (economy version), SYSTEM 16, SYSTEM 24, SYSTEM 32.

The core principle was that by establishing a standardized system board, you did not need to design a new board for every game. The same board with different software content produced a new game. This philosophy originated from the G80 board at Gremlin ("G" for Gremlin, "80" for Z80), which Sato learned about during his time training in Los Angeles after Sega's acquisition of Gremlin.

## MODEL Series and Military Partnership

**Sato:** "We partnered with General Electric's military division for CG technology -- they made flight and tank simulators. GE shared older, declassified technology in exchange for development fees. This led to MODEL 2 with texture mapping."

GE subsequently sold its military simulation division to Martin Marietta. MODEL 3 was completed at Martin Marietta.

The MODEL series represented Sega's cutting-edge 3D computer graphics arcade hardware:
- **MODEL 1** -- First generation 3D CG board, used for Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter
- **MODEL 2** -- Added texture mapping capability through the GE partnership
- **MODEL 3** -- Completed at Martin Marietta after GE's sale

## NVIDIA's Origin Story

**Sato:** "When NVIDIA was still really small -- maybe about 30 people -- I asked the founder, Jensen Huang, and we invested money to have them develop a graphics chip. But the project failed. However, when we invested that money, we negotiated for stock. From Sega, we had Yu Suzuki and others aggressively requesting specific capabilities. Jensen Huang absorbed what functions were necessary for games and imprinted all of it into his chips. The result was an excellent chip that got into PCs and became today's GeForce."

This early investment and technical collaboration between Sega and the then-tiny NVIDIA played a formative role in NVIDIA's understanding of what graphics capabilities were needed for real-time game rendering. The specific functional requirements communicated by Sega's engineers, particularly Yu Suzuki, helped shape the architecture that would eventually become the GeForce line of consumer graphics processors.

## Yu Suzuki

**Sato on Suzuki:** "Aggressive, intensely curious, capable, with a mathematics background. He volunteered for 3D CG work and became the flagship engineer for MODEL 1 and the Virtua series."

Yu Suzuki was one of Sega's most important creative and technical figures, responsible for landmark titles including Virtua Racing, Virtua Fighter, and later Shenmue. His mathematics background gave him a particular aptitude for 3D computer graphics work.

## Super Derby and Technical Innovation

The arcade medal game Super Derby used a free-track system with custom brushless motors sourced from Nihon Servo, combined with digitizer technology. This project showcased Sato's ability to forge partnerships with smaller companies that were excited by technically interesting challenges.

The approach of seeking out specialized component manufacturers who could be motivated by the novelty and technical interest of the project -- rather than relying solely on large suppliers -- was a recurring element of Sato's engineering management style throughout his career at Sega.
