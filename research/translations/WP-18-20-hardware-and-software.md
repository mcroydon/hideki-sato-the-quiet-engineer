## CSK/Okawa Isao Acquires Sega

Okawa Isao (大川功), founder of CSK, purchased Sega from Paramount for approximately 8 billion yen. Sony's Ohga Norio had nearly acquired Sega first -- he came to negotiate but was ultimately outbid.

**Sato on Ohga:** "Ohga set the CD length at 64 minutes because that's how long Beethoven's Ninth is. He was an orchestra conductor."

## Mega Drive and Semiconductor Partnerships

For the Mega Drive, Sato procured the MC68000 from Signetics at an astonishing 300 yen per unit (the normal price was around 3,000 yen) by guaranteeing 300,000 units.

**Sato on FM sound and Yamaha:** "The FM chip existed in Yamaha's musical instrument division. Their president Kawakami ordered the release to Sega. That FM sound became the standard for PC sound -- the Sound Blaster was essentially the same architecture."

## The Tetris License Disaster

Sega had huge success with Tetris in arcades, then developed a Mega Drive version. But Nintendo made an end-run to ELORG (the Soviet rights holder) and secured home console rights.

**Sato:** "We had already produced the cartridges. They had to be destroyed."

## The Birth of Sonic

**Sato on Yuji Naka:** "An obsessive perfectionist programmer/director." Sonic was designed to be completely different from Mario.

**Sato on U.S. success:** "SOA's comparative advertising was brilliant. They beat Nintendo 55-44 in U.S. market share."

## Super 32X Failure

**Sato:** "We wasted about 3 billion yen on Samsung DSP chips for the Super 32X that were mostly unused."

## EA's Reverse-Engineering and Lawsuit

**Sato:** "EA reverse-engineered our boot ROM security and made their own cartridges. We sued; they counter-sued. The Coyle patent case cost us 57 billion yen."
