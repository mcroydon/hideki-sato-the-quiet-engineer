## Section 1: Upbringing -- Repeated Moves

**Q:** Let us begin, thank you for your time. Today, in terms of chronological flow, we would like to hear up to around the time you joined the company in 1971, or perhaps just a little beyond that. First, to confirm: you were born in Hokkaido in 1950. We would like you to look back on your childhood. Where in Hokkaido were you born?

**Sato:** "I was born in a place called Ashibetsu in Hokkaido -- it was a coal mining town at the time. I was born there. Below me, I have a sister four years younger, and then a brother two years younger than her -- a five-person family with our parents. I was the eldest son. I heard about it later -- I asked why they named me Hideki, and they said it was because Hideki Yukawa had won the Nobel Prize, so they decided to borrow from his name. I think my old man was just too lazy to think of a name (laughs). So I'm Hideki, and proof of the laziness is that my sister is Yoshiko -- basically 'good child.' And my brother -- well, since I was Hideki, they went, 'let's just call him Naoki' or something like that (laughs). I have a feeling the names were given in a rather haphazard way. Both my parents have passed away, so I can't ask them about it anymore. They died, so I don't know the real reasons."

**Sato:** "I was born in Ashibetsu, Hokkaido, and after that we moved around quite a lot. That said, it was all within the Sorachi District. There's a district called Sorachi. For better or worse, my father was a bit of an unusual man. To put it nicely, he was really Americanized -- if someone recognized his ability and skills, he would move to wherever offered a step up. That's the kind of thinking he had. Because of that: I was born in Ashibetsu, then we moved to Nokanan. It's near Furano -- Furano City, Aza Nokanan, or something like that."

**Q:** Is "Nokanan" a place name?

**Sato:** "Nokanan -- it's written with the characters for 'field,' 'flower,' and 'south.' I believe I entered elementary school in Nokanan. From Nokanan, we went to Shimanoshita, then to Utashinai -- that was also a coal mining town, I think. We went to Utashinai, then back to Ashibetsu again. We moved around a lot."

**Q:** Was this because of your father's work?

**Sato:** "That's right. My father worked with saws at sawmills -- and I don't mean a small handsaw. These were huge saws used in sawmills. There were circular saws, and band saws -- about 30 centimeters wide with teeth on one side. His job was sharpening those saw blades. Basically, saws get dull with use, and he would sharpen them. So we moved from one sawmill area to another, and each time we'd have to relocate."

**Sato:** "Back then, the only transportation was the train, so there wasn't really a concept of commuting. Nowadays you have a car -- say my father moved from Shimanoshita to Utashinai, it might be 30 minutes by car, or even an hour, and you could commute. But back then, a car itself was one of the 'Three Sacred Treasures,' the three Cs as they were called -- completely out of reach for people like us."

**Sato:** "So it was just move after move after move. In a bad year, we'd move about every year and a half. To put it nicely, he was being recruited for his skills, but personality-wise he was a bit odd, and he had trouble getting along with people. When they recruited him, they'd say, 'Please come, we're counting on you.' But once he got there and actually worked together with them, or from the employer's perspective, once they tried him out, he'd prove a bit difficult to work with, and gradually things wouldn't go well. Then after a year, year and a half, two years, another offer would come from elsewhere. His skill was genuinely good, apparently. And he'd be called away again."

**Sato:** "That meant I'd enter a school, and after about a year it was time to transfer again. Just when I'd finally gotten used to things, another transfer. I went through the experience of being a transfer student over and over."

**Sato:** "When you transfer, if you haven't experienced it you might not understand, but at first it's really unpleasant. You go somewhere where you don't know a single person (laughs), and you have to introduce yourself -- 'I'm Hideki Sato, such and such, my hobby is this.' At first you're alone, you have no friends. Then some of the more outgoing kids would come talk to you, and gradually, bit by bit, you'd start building friendships and relationships. But those first few months, you really feel lonely."

**Sato:** "At one point I said I didn't want to transfer anymore. So they said, 'Fine, we'll buy you a television.' And I caved immediately. Back then, a house that had a television was either a wealthy household or a shop. So we'd go to those places to watch. It wasn't just me -- there were always a bunch of kids. Especially at this one shop -- from around 5 or 6 in the evening, all these brats would gather to watch TV, then head home. I thought, if we had our own TV -- of course it was black and white -- I could watch as much as I wanted. So my parents basically bought my silence, bribed me with a TV: 'We'll buy you a TV, so be quiet.' I fell for it and said, 'Fine then.' But once you enter the new school, you still don't have friends right away, so you have to endure that loneliness again. Then gradually, gradually you get used to it. And just when you've gotten used to it -- another transfer."

**Sato:** "One time, as I mentioned, I said goodbye through tears. It was around the fifth grade of elementary school, I think. We moved from Ashibetsu to -- I forget whether it was Utashinai -- somewhere. Then my old man got recruited again by a different sawmill in Ashibetsu. So we moved again. Around fifth grade, I said goodbye with tears streaming."

**Sato:** "Then, around the first year of middle school, we moved back. Since it was roughly the same area, some of the classmates from elementary school were at the same middle school. So I transferred in as a new student, introduced myself -- 'I'm Hideki Sato' -- and there were some familiar faces. That was reassuring in a way, but also embarrassing. Really embarrassing. Like, what was all that tearful farewell about?"

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "What were those tears for? Anyway, I went back to the middle school area. Then the sawmill industry itself started declining because of foreign lumber -- imported wood was coming in from overseas. Sawmills in Hokkaido were becoming a sunset industry. The sawmill where my father worked had to close. So my father decided to go to Tokyo -- there was Kiba [the lumber district], and he wanted to work there. He went to Tokyo alone at first."

**Sato:** "He went to Kiba. From what he told me, he went there and said he had years of experience sharpening saw blades and was confident in his skill. But by that time, saw sharpening was a certified trade -- you needed a national qualification. At a place like Kiba, they wouldn't hire you without that certification. So he came to Tokyo but couldn't do the work he'd been doing his whole life."

**Sato:** "After various struggles -- I don't know the details -- there was an automobile company called Prince Motors at the time. Nissan later absorbed it -- for a while it was called Nissan Prince. He was hired there as a seasonal worker: employed for a season, then let go. A temporary position. But whether it was saw sharpening or something else, his technical skill was recognized, and he was eventually brought on as a full employee at Prince."

**Sato:** "While my father was in Tokyo, my mother and the three of us siblings stayed in Hokkaido, living off his remittances. Once he had a stable job here, he said, 'Come on out.' So around the first year of middle school, we came to Tokyo."

**Q:** That would be around 1963?

**Sato:** "Around '63. So just before the Olympics. Maybe '64. At around the first year of middle school, I had reasonably decent grades."

**Q:** Where in Tokyo did you settle?

**Sato:** "Hachioji. I enrolled at the Seventh Middle School in Hachioji. The reason was that my father was working at the Nissan Prince factory in Musashimurayama. It was a huge factory. It's all gone now -- it's become some kind of shopping mall area."

**Q:** Is that where the Aeon and such are now?

**Sato:** "Yes, that's right. Since he was working there as an employee, they needed nearby housing. We didn't have much money, so there was something called the Employment Promotion Corporation -- a public entity for promoting employment -- that operated apartment complexes. There was one in Hachioji, in a place called Kobiki-cho. Kobiki is written with the characters for 'small,' 'compare,' and 'plan.' There was a crematorium right nearby. I joked later, 'When I die, just drag me over there -- it's convenient' (laughs). There was a housing complex in Kobiki-cho, and we were able to move in. My father was already there, and then my mother and the three of us siblings joined him. Looking back, it was a tiny place. The layout was maybe 2K -- a 6-mat room, a 3-mat room, and a kitchen. The kitchen was maybe 2 mats. Five family members in that space."

## Section 2: Childhood -- Play, Studies, and Home Life

**Q:** Before middle school, during elementary school, what kind of play did you do with friends?

**Sato:** "What I remember is marbles. And what we call 'menko' here -- in Hokkaido we called them 'pacchi.' Thick printed cardboard discs. You'd slap them down on the table, and if you knocked the other person's over, you got to keep it. Or flip it over. Then there was sword fighting -- 'chanbara.' For that you needed a group of kids. When I was in the lower grades there were older kids, and we'd just tag along running after them. That was about the extent of it. There were no video games, of course."

**Q:** What about book-lending shops or manga?

**Sato:** "I hardly read anything back then. Book-lending shops existed, I think, but I had almost no contact with them."

**Q:** What did you watch on the TV you got?

**Sato:** "On TV, I liked shows like 'Kaiketsu Harimao' and 'National Kid' -- those are what I remember now. Red Hood, something Hood -- those kinds of action adventure shows. I liked that sort of thing."

**Sato:** "Hokkaido had maybe three TV stations. NHK, and for commercial broadcasting, one or at most two channels. So you really couldn't choose programs. When I came to Tokyo I was truly shocked -- there were so many channels. Back then we only had channel 1, channel 3, and maybe one or two more, switching with that clunk-clunk dial. So our play was mainly the things I mentioned. Did I read books? I hardly read anything."

**Sato:** "I only really started reading novels after coming to Tokyo. Around just before entering high school, I read quite a few of what they call 'great works.' But I forgot everything after reading them. Before that, I barely read at all."

**Q:** What about manga? Tezuka Osamu's 'Astro Boy' was around the time you were born.

**Sato:** "What I remember is -- not 'Shonen Jump,' but 'Magazine' and 'Sunday.' That was around the fourth or fifth grade of elementary school. 'Sunday' was... right, right, either 'Magazine' or 'Sunday' had just launched. I remember that -- I bought it when it was first published. Then 'Shonen Champion' or something launched a little later, and after that Jump or something came out."

**Q:** 'Sunday' was first published in 1959.

**Sato:** "Ah, so I was nine. That might be right. I think I was in Ashibetsu around that time. I remember buying it there. I begged my parents -- 'buy it for me' -- and they did."

**Q:** How were your studies in elementary school?

**Sato:** "Honestly, I was on the poor side academically. But here's the thing -- I'm the type who does well when praised. So with female teachers, who tend to be good at that -- I still remember, in the first grade, I think. First grade was at Shimanoshita. It was rural, so student numbers were small even then. First and second grade were combined, third and fourth together, fifth and sixth together -- about three classes. One teacher would teach the second graders while we first graders did self-study, then switch."

**Sato:** "The teacher who taught us then -- the homeroom teacher -- I still remember her name, though I've completely forgotten her face. Her name was Shimomura-sensei, a woman. She was good at praising me, and I really worked hard at studying. What was my best subject? I said arithmetic. I'm amazed I could say that back then, but arithmetic, yes. With her kind of encouragement, I did reasonably well."

**Sato:** "At a school arts festival, I was chosen as one of the good readers for reading aloud, and I got a decent role in the performance -- not just standing there. But since student numbers were small, even a so-so student could get a leading role. I think I did fine in first and second grade."

**Sato:** "But then, as I mentioned, we'd transfer. The textbooks would be different, the pace of lessons would be different. The new teacher wouldn't praise me from the start. And with a male teacher, forget it -- they don't have that sensibility for praising students. So when I wasn't being praised, I'd fall apart completely. My grades would stop improving."

**Sato:** "Then around fourth grade, I got another female teacher. This was back in Ashibetsu. She praised me well, and I studied hard. My mother mentioned later that I was filling up those CAMPUS notebooks in just a few days, studying like crazy, going through notebook after notebook. So my grades were decent then. But then another transfer, another male teacher, and I'd fall apart again. So if you ask whether my grades were good overall, they were probably bad. On the whole."

**Sato:** "But my mother once told me that when I was very small, she took me to a fortune teller -- some kind of physiognomist or name reader. The fortune teller said, 'This child is a late bloomer' (laughs). So from my mother's perspective: 'You're no good now, but maybe that fortune will come true and you'll improve eventually.' She'd use that to try to motivate me -- 'The fortune teller said so!'"

**Q:** How was your relationship with your siblings? Did you play together?

**Sato:** "My sister was born in 1954 -- Showa 29 -- and my brother in 1955 -- Showa 30. They were close in age to each other but a bit apart from me. Rather than playing together, I have more of a sense that I was looking after them."

**Sato:** "Our family was really poor, so my mother also went out to work. That left the three of us at home, and we had to handle meal preparation, cleaning, everything among ourselves. So -- who washes the dishes, who cleans, who washes the rice, who sweeps? We divided the chores. I did my share and made my younger siblings do theirs too, but since they were four or five years younger, in the end I could do everything faster myself. I found it really annoying, but it had to be done. The thing I hated most was washing dishes. I hated it. But like it or not, after everyone eats, someone has to wash up. We didn't have that many dishes or bowls anyway. It wasn't like there were all these side dishes spread out on the table."

**Sato:** "What often appeared on our dinner table was whale. Whale would come in frozen blocks -- what you'd call 'partial' nowadays, half-frozen. We'd slice it thinly, eat it like sashimi with soy sauce. Back then it was like, 'Whale again?' (laughs)."

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "It's probably delicious if you eat it now, but it came in that semi-frozen state, and as it gradually thawed, blood would slowly pool at the bottom. That would be one dish, plus miso soup, and that was about it. Really nothing much."

**Sato:** "As for meat other than whale, we hardly ever got any. One time -- I forget how old I was -- I said to my mother, 'I hear there's something called beef. Can you let me try beef?' She said, 'Hideki, that stuff smells like milk, it's no good.' But when I actually tried it later, it wasn't milky at all -- it was delicious."

**Sato:** "So back then, if there was a special occasion, at best we'd have Genghis Khan [lamb barbecue]. After a while, there was something called 'niku-nabe' -- a sukiyaki imitation. We called it niku-nabe at home, but it used pork instead of beef, simmered in soy sauce. That happened maybe a few times a year."

**Sato:** "Around the time I was entering middle school, there was instant spaghetti Napolitan. You'd heat it up or fry it in a pan -- I forget exactly. When I ate that, I was so moved. There was hardly anything in it -- no real ingredients. Just ketchup flavor on noodles that weren't soba or udon. I thought, 'Something this delicious exists?'"

**Sato:** "When it came to food, it was really rough. People say, 'Hokkaido must have great food, seafood and all.' But Sorachi District is right in the middle of Hokkaido. There were almost no refrigerators back then. So if you transported fish, you had to eat it right away. The logistics were basically just trains, not very good. Fresh food was basically frozen or semi-frozen. I never had good seafood."

**Sato:** "I still remember -- I think it was a place called Shimanoshita -- there were only about two stores. One was near our house. It had various food items but no refrigerator. You'd open the lid, and there'd be fried tofu or fish-paste products inside. Sometimes, for a change from whale, my mother would buy some and grill it. And when she did -- I was shocked -- maggots came out. Because it was hot, they'd come crawling out. That's how bad the hygiene was. Back then all the toilets were pit latrines, and maggots were everywhere. So the same kind of thing that lived in the toilet was coming out of our food when we cooked it. That was truly a shock."

**Sato:** "But the place called Shimanoshita -- when I think of it now, I only have beautiful images. There was a river flowing behind our house. A stream, really, but with good water flow at the time, feeding into the Sorachi River. The water was very clean. We'd play in the water there. It wasn't very deep -- maybe just above the knees."

**Sato:** "There were sculpin and loaches everywhere. I'd catch sculpin. Sculpin have big heads and big mouths, they're really small fish. They're so dumb that once they bite the bait, they won't let go. You pull the line up and they come right with it. The bait? Earthworms. There was someone nearby who raised pigs, and there was some kind of feed -- maybe rice bran -- left around. You'd dig a little and worms would come swarming out. I'd thread them onto a hook and line, bunch up dozens of worms into a ball, lower it to where the sculpin were, and they'd come bite. Pull them up, set them aside... and then what? I never ate them. They'd die after a while and I'd throw them back. Loaches were harder to catch."

**Q:** [Confirms the sculpin-fishing technique]

**Sato:** "The water was flowing so you couldn't see well. So I'd take a piece of broken glass and hold it against the water surface -- like a makeshift goggle. There were no goggles or swim masks. Through the glass I could see the sculpin and loaches, and I'd lower the bait to them. The sculpin would bite right away. But I never did anything with what I caught -- just caught them and threw them away. Quite cruel, when you think about it. But behind our house there was this stream with beautifully clean water."

**Sato:** "Actually, about ten years after joining the company, I went back to Hokkaido for a Sega recruiting trip. At the time, hardly anyone knew Sega. I was doing college recruitment, holding information sessions in Sapporo. It happened to be summer, so I brought my wife along for a vacation. I went back to Shimanoshita to show her that beautiful river. But the river had dried up and become a filthy ditch. That really made me think -- some things are better left as memories."

**Sato:** "I also remember -- I don't know what I'd done wrong -- but my mother got furious and said, 'I don't need you!' She dragged me to the river, where there was a sort of cliff, a ledge above the water. She threatened to throw me in. But along the cliff face there were vines -- grape vines and such -- growing horizontally everywhere. So while she was holding me by the scruff of my neck going, 'I'll drop you, I'll drop you,' my feet were firmly hooked on the vines (laughs). I wasn't going to fall."

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Sato:** "I was pulling myself along the vines. It was actually safer to hang on to the vines than to have her half-gripping my collar. Then my mother started to panic. I told her later, 'I had my feet on the vines the whole time, I was totally fine' (laughs). Those are the kinds of memories you have growing up in the countryside."

**Sato:** "We had no bath in our house, not at all. In Shimanoshita, there was a hot spring nearby -- about a 30-minute walk. We'd go bathe there about once a week. Along the way there were fields everywhere. Since we never had enough to eat, I'd pull up a daikon radish from someone's field. The green part near the top is actually a bit sweet. I'd scrape off the skin with my teeth and munch on the raw daikon as we walked."

## Section 3: Childhood -- Personality

**Q:** Looking back now, what kind of personality would you say you had as an elementary school child?

**Sato:** "When I was being praised and thriving, I was really active -- loud, even. My report cards apparently often said 'lacks composure.' I was given roles like class monitor, calling out 'Stand! Bow!' It was right after the baby boom generation, so there were still lots of students. Each class had about 50 kids, desks crammed together."

**Sato:** "I'd be chattering with the kid next to me, turning around in my seat, making a fuss. That was when I was in an environment where I could be myself. But as I've been saying, when I transferred to a new school, at first I had to be quiet -- I wasn't used to the place yet. Fundamentally, I think I'm actually the quiet type. Very introverted, shy, the kind who has trouble with strangers. But when someone recognizes me or accepts me, I get carried away. In Hokkaido we say 'odatsu' -- getting excited, getting full of oneself. I was often told, 'You're being odatsu again.'"

**Sato:** "But going through all those transfers, your personality starts getting twisted. Instead of going straight, you bend this way and that. You finally get used to a place, and then you're bent in another direction. Your personality gets warped."

**Q:** So in the Hokkaido towns, there were very few stores?

**Sato:** "That's right."

**Q:** In other oral histories, people who grew up in urban areas talk about dagashi-ya [penny candy shops] as gathering spots for kids' communities. Was there anything like that?

**Sato:** "There were dagashi-ya, dry goods stores... Ashibetsu had a population of maybe 40,000 to 50,000 at the time. Not a big town. The shop I mentioned where we'd go to watch TV -- friends would gather there. Especially on Sundays, when shows like 'National Kid' were on. Everyone would congregate, watch TV intently, and then scatter to go play. So that shop was a kind of community center. Not just kids the same age -- the older elementary school kids were there too."

---

## Section 4: Childhood -- Outdoor Play

**Q:** Did you mostly play at friends' houses, or was it more outdoor play -- catching bugs, interacting with nature?

**Sato:** "For bug catching, what I remember is catching dragonflies. In Hokkaido, starting from around August, there are just unbelievable numbers of dragonflies. To catch them you'd normally use a net. But we couldn't afford nets."

**Sato:** "So how did we catch them? You could grab them by hand, of course. But to catch the big ones like giant dragonflies, since we had no nets, we used spiderwebs. You'd bend wire into a circle, attach it to the end of a stick. Then you'd press spiderweb onto it. One layer isn't strong enough, but there were spiders and webs everywhere, so you'd layer on five or six webs and it would become quite sturdy. And since it's spiderweb, it's sticky. You'd swing it at a dragonfly and the wings would stick right to it."

**Sato:** "Plain red dragonflies weren't exciting to catch. Shiokaras [salt dragonflies, a grey species] were better. But what you really wanted was an oniyamma [giant dragonfly]. Those are huge. But you could almost never catch one. I actually ate a dragonfly once. I'm amazed I did. You'd pull off the head and tail, pluck off the legs and wings, and eat it. It didn't taste good. I also caught bees, removed the stinger, and ate them. They were a little sweet, actually."

**Q:** Not bee larvae -- the actual bee?

**Sato:** "The bee itself. Looking back, I can't believe I ate things like that. For snacks, about once a year we'd get a big tin can of what you might call cookies. They were shaped like A, B, C or 1, 2, 3. We'd get five or six of those as a day's snack. They weren't particularly sweet."

**Q:** Like saltine crackers?

**Sato:** "Something like that. In elementary school, what I often ate was -- there was a senbei [rice cracker] shop nearby that made salt senbei. When they pressed the batter into the molds and baked them, the excess would overflow and make 'ears' -- edges. Some would puff up, some would be flat. The factory couldn't sell senbei with the ears still on, so they'd trim them off. And we kids would go buy those ear trimmings. A whole bag for 5 yen. Those senbei ears were delicious. I still like salt senbei, but those ear pieces were special. And they were incredibly cheap."

**Q:** Like buying bread crusts at a bakery?

**Sato:** "Exactly. I actually prefer the heel of the bread -- the end pieces with the crust. My wife goes to a bakery nearby, and since they know I like the crusts, they set some aside for me. So with 5 yen you could get a huge bag and munch away. Definitely tastier than eating dragonflies (laughs)."

**Sato:** "In Hokkaido, there are no cockroaches. When I first came to Tokyo and saw one, I thought it was just a regular insect. In Hokkaido we had stag beetles, grasshoppers, all kinds of insects everywhere. When I brought my wife back to Shimanoshita years later, she was paralyzed -- couldn't move. Dragonflies swarming everywhere, grasshoppers bouncing around. She said she never wanted to go back."

**Sato:** "So when I first saw a cockroach, I thought nothing of it -- just another bug. Later someone told me they're incredibly unsanitary. Having grown up around insects, I had no resistance to touching them."

**Sato:** "People always say, 'You grew up in Hokkaido, so you must be great at skiing.' I did ski, but it wasn't an everyday thing. Snow was just a nuisance. Maybe five times a season. But I was at least familiar with it."

**Sato:** [He continues with a story about skiing later as an adult at Sega -- discovering that all the equipment had changed. New boots were rigid and went up to below the knee, unlike the old rubber boots with ankle flexibility. He couldn't turn at first. But his familiarity with snow helped him adjust.]

---

## Section 5: Childhood -- Toys

**Q:** Do you remember the first toy you were given, or a toy you played with a lot?

**Sato:** "Toys... well, we were poor, so I wasn't bought much. At some point I got into plastic models. Especially tanks. That was probably in Hokkaido, around the first year of middle school or so."

**Sato:** "Now I'll confess -- I shoplifted once. It was a plastic model that cost about 2,500 to 2,600 yen -- a tank. That was a huge amount at the time. When my father got a bonus and was thrilled -- I have a faint memory of us all going to a Chinese restaurant to celebrate. That bonus was 10,000 yen. So 2,500-2,600 yen, maybe 3,000 yen, was a huge sum."

**Sato:** "It was a big box, about 60 by 30 centimeters. A Tiger tank. With a motor and batteries. The thing was, the shop that sold it was being renovated or cleaned, and the merchandise was outside. So it was kind of like they were saying 'please take it,' right? I must have really wanted it. I'm still amazed I didn't get caught -- it was huge."

**Q:** It's a big box.

**Sato:** "I grabbed it and ran. Back home, I threw myself into assembling it, gluing things with Cemedine [model cement]. The other kind of pilfering we did was farm produce. A group of us would go swipe something -- I forget what -- stuff our pockets full. Then we got spotted and chased. For some reason, as we ran we'd throw away what was in our pockets, like some kind of penance. If you're going to run anyway, you might as well keep the loot and enjoy it later. But we'd toss it and run."

**Sato:** "Also mulberries. In season, mulberry trees produce those purple berries. They're sweet and sour, very juicy -- if you pinch them too hard they burst and the purple juice gets everywhere. We'd eat them right off the tree. Being up in the tree, I'd fall and slam my back on the ground. I'm lucky I didn't die."

**Sato:** "We didn't have proper snacks, so we'd eat wild strawberries, mulberries, whatever we could find. That's how we got our sweetness."

**Sato:** "Back then, the value system was different. Nutritious things, sweet things -- those were luxuries. They used to say that sugar consumption was a barometer of civilization. So getting to eat something sweet meant your standard of living had risen. Now it's the opposite -- high-calorie foods are bad for you."

**Sato:** "My mother was really something, though. For making pickles, she'd buy whole daikon radishes by the truckload, wash them, tie them with rope and hang them to dry -- maybe hundreds of them. Then pack them into pickle barrels, salt them, press them with weights. Then the same for Chinese cabbage, then eggplant. Every year, massive quantities of pickles. She must have had over 30 barrels."

**Sato:** "My father would pound mochi [rice cakes] all by himself -- I don't know how many sho [a unit of measure] he'd do. Dozens of sho. Mochi was a food source for winter. He'd steam the rice, my mother would turn it, and he'd pound with the mallet. They'd go on and on. His stamina was incredible."

**Sato:** "My father was born in 1924 -- Taisho 13 -- and died at 76. My mother was born in 1927 -- Showa 2 -- and died at 68. So I figure I'll die at 72 -- average the two and split the difference genetically. That means I've got about five more years."

**Sato:** "Now, regarding toys and how they connect to games -- I did plastic models. The small ones with rubber treads weren't expensive, and I think those were properly purchased. The 2,500-3,000 yen Tiger tank was, well, 'salvaged.' It was sitting right there, after all (laughs)."

**Sato:** "What I noticed with the Tiger tank was that the batteries ran out quickly. I thought, 'There must be a way to fix this.' I researched and found something called a 'storage battery' -- a capacitor. If you had one, you could store electricity. Then I also learned about transformers -- you could step down voltage and supply power. I looked into it, but that's as far as I got as a kid. A transformer alone isn't enough -- you need to rectify the current into DC. That was beyond what my child's brain could figure out."

## Section 6: Childhood -- Allowance from Parents

**Q:** When did your parents start giving you an allowance, and roughly how much?

**Sato:** "I don't remember ever getting a regular monthly allowance. Actually, it was more like confiscation. If I received some money for New Year's from an uncle or aunt, my parents would say, 'We'll hold onto this for you.'"

**Q:** They would just take the New Year's money?

**Sato:** "When I needed something, I'd ask and sometimes they'd give in. Or I'd go to where my father worked and say, 'I want to see a movie, give me some money.' Back then a child's movie ticket was maybe 30 or 40 yen. There was a movie theater in Ashibetsu, and I'd go see movies with that 30 or 40 yen. I vaguely remember seeing 'The Longest Day' or something like that. But there was never a set monthly allowance."

**Sato:** "For Christmas, one cake would appear on the table. That was the one time per year we got cake. We'd cut it up -- I don't remember how we divided it -- but wow, that was a treat. We really looked forward to it."

**Q:** What about birthdays -- any presents or pocket money?

**Sato:** "Birthdays... I think there was almost nothing for birthdays. We just didn't have the money. I think that was pretty normal for everyone back then."

**Sato:** "It was Hokkaido backcountry. Shimanoshita -- I mean, the name says it all. The population might have been 1,000, maybe less. Nearby someone was raising pigs. There were only two stores."

**Sato:** "One thing I remember -- I think it was the Showa Emperor -- the Imperial train passed through. The Emperor was visiting Furano, which was a bigger town. Shimanoshita was just a tiny part of Furano City. When word got out that the Imperial train would pass through, all the elementary school students lined up at Shimanoshita Station -- not that it would stop there, it just passed through. Then apparently my father, out of curiosity, said, 'Let's go to Furano!' There was a huge crowd. Everyone gathered around the hotel where the Emperor was staying, even though he never came out. There was nothing else going on, so any event at all would draw everyone. There might have been 50 or 60 students total at the school. About 10 per grade."
