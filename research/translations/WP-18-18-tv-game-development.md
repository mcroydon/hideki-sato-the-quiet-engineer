## How Sato Came to Join Sega

**Q:** In our last session, we covered up through your university graduation. This time we'd like to start from after graduation and your joining the company, and go as deep as we can. First, I'd like to ask about your joining Sega in April 1971. There may be some overlap with last time, but could you tell us once more about the circumstances of how you came to join?

**Sato:** "Sure. This may overlap with what I said before, but I graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of Tokyo Metropolitan Junior College, and that's how I ended up entering Sega. But before that, I had been aiming for the Overseas Youth Cooperation Corps -- under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, as it was called then. It was a kind of farming training program. I'd heard all sorts of stories from a neighbor who had participated in it, and he said the two years were tremendously enjoyable. He'd gone to America, and during that time he'd gotten his driver's license very easily. He told me, 'If you transfer it to Japan, it automatically becomes a Japanese license,' and from there he went on about how wonderful life over there had been. So I wanted to go. When I was graduating, I was actually doing all sorts of things to try to get in. But in the end, I was basically pretending to be a farmer even though I wasn't one -- I'd been lying about it because I wanted to go so badly, and I suppose they found out."

"So that fell through. Then I met up with some classmates and we were drinking and talking, and -- this may seem obvious -- each of them was saying where they were going to work. April was right around the corner; it was around March 24th or 25th. One guy was going to Fujitsu, another to Trio, another to Casio -- it was all electronics-related since that was our field. And here I was, having planned on the Youth Cooperation Corps and having done absolutely zero job hunting. I'd figured it would work out somehow, but it didn't. When I heard that everyone else had proper jobs starting in April, I panicked."

"I went to the school and told the career placement teacher that I wanted to find a job. He said, 'You come here now and say that?!' It was March 25th, after all. 'What the hell are you talking about? You said you weren't going to get a job!' I begged him, and after listening to me, the name he came up with was Fujisoku -- a company that makes switches and outlets. They're still a well-known company today. He said he might be able to get me in there. But it didn't sound interesting. Flip a switch and electricity flows. Plug into an outlet and electricity flows. Not interesting. I told him, 'Teacher, that's not interesting. Isn't there something else?' That just made him angrier. 'I don't care anymore. Go to the job placement room and find something yourself!'"

"So for the first time, I went to the room where all the career-related materials were kept, thinking this was hopeless. Then the name Tomy caught my eye. Since I'd loved model kits and things like that as a kid, I figured Tomy would be fun since they make toys. So I called Tomy. They said, 'Applications are already closed.' I thought it was strange -- there was still about a week left. Since I'd done absolutely no job hunting, I didn't understand why they'd already closed. But if they said they were closed, there was nothing I could do."

"Then, looking around some more, I found Sega's company brochure. When I looked at it, at the time they were making slot machines, jukeboxes, and some games -- arcade game machines. Looking at the photos, it seemed interesting. There were semiconductors attached and things like that. So I thought, 'Sega looks interesting.' I checked the address -- it was at Otorii, which is two stops from Keikyu Kamata on the airport line. My school, Tokyo Metropolitan Technical Junior College, was at Samezu, also on the Keikyu line. From Samezu to Keikyu Kamata, the transfer point, was only two or three stops. So it was close! I figured if I called, I might get turned away again, so I decided just to go in person. I went straight to Sega on foot."

"From there, I had two or three strokes of luck. First, the section chief in charge of hiring was a graduate of Tokyo Metropolitan University. I was from the junior college, but we were both from the 'Metropolitan' system, so he said something like, 'Oh, same Metropolitan, huh?' Second, by March 25th, the HR people had nothing to do. Recruiting was basically finished and all that was left was preparing for the entrance ceremony. They were bored. Perhaps partly to kill time, they treated me very courteously."

"Then, rather boldly, since I was going to join, I wanted to see where I'd be working, so I asked them to show me around the company. Since they had free time, they gave me a full tour. I saw R&D and Production & Engineering [P&E]. Those looked like they were doing interesting work. The factory didn't seem right for me -- I have no patience, so I figured I'd get sick of it quickly. So I said I wanted R&D or P&E, and nowhere else."

"Then came another stroke of luck. It happened that Sega had been recruiting three people. Two had apparently agreed to come, but one spot was still open. So they told me to go talk with the department head and deputy head of development at the time. Looking back now, that must have been my job interview. We talked -- mostly casual conversation, plus they mentioned something about lasers and tossed me a question. I didn't really understand, but apparently I gave some kind of answer."

"They also told me, 'Sato, even if you join development, you won't be doing development work right away.' At first, I'd be working essentially as a factory hand -- making things for development projects. Cutting sheet metal, bending it, punching holes, cutting wood -- that kind of work. They asked, 'Is that okay with you?' Since I loved making things -- model kits and all that -- I said, 'That's perfectly fine.' Then they said, 'Go back to HR.' I think while I was walking back, the decision to hire me was made by phone."

"HR asked me, 'Did you bring your transcript?' I said, 'No, no, I didn't prepare anything at all.' I'd just found the listing in the school's job room and came straight here without even calling. 'Do you have a health certificate?' Of course I didn't. But they said, 'Well, that's fine. Welcome aboard.' And that's how it started."

**Q:** So it was decided that very day?

**Sato:** "That very day. They just told me to bring my transcript later. So they knew nothing about my grades. Another lucky thing was that the department head and deputy head I talked with -- they were really good people. Genuinely good people. I actually asked that department head to be the go-between at my wedding later on. If they hadn't been nice people, they probably would have said, 'Who does this kid think he is?' and turned me down. All these lucky breaks piled up, and on March 25th, I joined Sega."

"At the time, nobody knew what Sega was. They were putting out arcade machines, and they were Japan's number one jukebox operator, but -- and maybe this is obvious -- when you go to a game center, nobody cares who the manufacturer is. If it looks fun, you put your money in and play. Same with jukeboxes -- you enjoy the artist, the music. Nobody knew Sega even as the biggest jukebox operator. It was essentially an unknown company, so even when they recruited, very few people applied. That's why they recruited three people for development and only got two. They hired someone like me -- it was at a level where they'd take anyone who showed up, regardless of ability."

### Salary and Company Background

**Sato:** "My starting salary was about 32,000 yen per month. Also, Sega was actually a foreign-owned company, under the umbrella of Paramount. The founder was David Rosen -- a Jewish American. He was very kind to me too. What he first brought to Japan was photo machines -- those automatic photo booths. After that, he brought in used slot machines, then jukeboxes, renting out records weekly."

**Q:** The photo machines are mentioned in our reference materials. It says "Photorama."

**Sato:** "That's right, Photorama. It was revolutionary for its time -- you put in money, it snapped a photo, and it came out. They're everywhere now, but back then it was black-and-white instant photos. As I mentioned, the 130-some employees were involved in operations, maintenance, record swapping, and so on. The cars back then were all black, with a logo that was different from today's -- more angular, with white lettering spelling out SEGA. Apparently their reputation wasn't great -- the driving was rough."

## Joining Sega and Assignment to Development (1971)

**Sato:** "So that's how I joined, and indeed, at first I was a factory hand."

**Q:** Your first assignment was directly to development?

**Sato:** "Development. The R&D Department. Being a foreign-owned company, they had distinctive foreign terminology. There was a 'parts room' that managed all the components, and when you needed parts, you'd write an order slip called an 'issue slip.' Travel was called 'outing.' When a project had to be cancelled, the word was 'void.' Management-level people all went by nicknames. Mr. Takahashi, the department head I mentioned -- he was called 'Masa.' It was an interesting company."

**Q:** At the time you joined in 1971, how many people were in the R&D Department?

**Sato:** "At most about 20 people. The fabrication team -- the hands-on manufacturing people -- numbered 7 or 8. Then there were people called 'researchers,' also about 7 or 8. Plus management, the department head, deputy head -- about 20 total."

**Q:** What was the R&D Department mainly researching and developing at the time?

**Sato:** "Arcade game machines. Back then, there were no microcomputers, of course no ICs. Not even transistors yet. Not even proper diodes -- they used selenium-type diodes, but nothing silicon-based like today."

### The Nature of Early Game Development: Mechanical, Not Electronic

**Sato:** "For control, they used relays -- you pass electricity and contacts close with a click. Also cams -- a motor with plates attached, and one rotation triggers a switch at the protruding part. That's how they controlled things back then."

"For driving games, for instance -- driving games are popular even now, but how do you build one when there's no TV? You attach models to chains and rotate the chains so they move around. You prepare several chains and randomly vary the speed. That way, opposing cars -- the competitor's cars -- become visible. Then you add your own car, which moves left and right with the steering wheel. To avoid physical collision, you use a half mirror -- what people call a magic mirror. Place it at 45 degrees, and you can see through from one side at 50% brightness. The other side reflects, so the images composite together. Since the transparency is 50%, they visually overlap -- the cars appear to collide even though physically they don't."

"There were also games using light sources -- a panel printed with patterns, illuminated from behind, projected onto a screen. Moving the rotating panel slightly up, down, left, or right made the projected image shift. They skillfully used half mirrors and light sources to build game machines."

"So there were driving games, shooting games, dogfight games -- aerial combat. That's what the development team was creating. My work at first in the workshop was making things like brackets -- sheet metal pieces attached to chains to hold model cars. A supervisor named the manager would say, 'Sato, you look free -- make this,' and hand me a drawing. I'd look at the blueprint and build it. Not just sheet metal but wood, plastics, all kinds of materials."

"Materials were abundant -- every type of aluminum from 0.X millimeters to 2-3mm, iron plate, copper plate, everything. Machine tools everywhere. So you could make almost anything. When we had free time, we'd make our own stereos out of sheet metal. Everyone would attach volume knobs, put in hairline-finished aluminum panels using sandpaper. Materials were there, tools were there. Some guys bought transistors in Akihabara at junk shops and assembled things. It was a very relaxed environment back then -- if you weren't busy, nobody cared."

**Q:** More like a mechanical workshop than a game company -- cutting boards, building from wood.

**Sato:** "That's right."

## Getting Into TV Games

**Q:** As things progressed, 1973 came around, and Atari released "PONG," and the TV game movement began. How did that unfold?

**Sato:** "I joined in '71, and a few years later things changed. Previously, the workshop and the researchers' rooms had been separate, with a door between them serving as security. But then they stopped dividing people into workshop staff and researcher staff; everyone would be in one section doing everything. I was assigned to a section called 'Flipper' [pinball], as the electrical engineer. There were just three of us. We did everything -- planning, electrical design, and fabricating whatever sheet metal we needed ourselves."

"Then came what you just mentioned -- 'PONTRON,' the PONG game. When I saw that, I was honestly shocked. Here's why: TV was something you watched. Using TV for a game -- that was by Nolan Bushnell, right? I met Bushnell several times, though I'm not sure whether he or someone else conceived it."

**Q:** It was probably Ralph Baer -- the person who created the Magnavox [Odyssey].

**Sato:** "Could be. After that, Nolan started Atari. As I said, they were using a TV. And on the circuit board, there were things I'd never seen before -- loads of them. Those were ICs. Back then it was SSI -- Small Scale Integration Circuit -- basically gates. AND, OR, at most MSI-level shift registers and counters. Nothing large-scale. But discrete ICs were packed tight on a 30-40 centimeter board. TTL -- Transistor-Transistor Logic. I couldn't make any sense of it at first."

"You could put any picture you wanted on the TV. As I said, TV was for watching, not using. I had no idea what signals were being sent to produce images. But even though it was just simple ping-pong, it was incredibly fun. It was a game we'd never played before."

### Understanding ICs Through Relay Logic

**Sato:** "From there, it was about mastering ICs and using TV. Honestly, the early stuff was basically copying Atari. The circuits. Relentlessly copying."

"First, I had to understand 'What are these things called ICs?' They had numbers like 7400, 74139, 74161 written on them. At first, I had no idea what any of it meant. Then I found out that Texas Instruments had these yellow data books. I'd look up 7400 and learn -- 'Oh, this is what this logic does. You put in 1 and 1 and you get 0.' This part actually came fairly easily to me. Why? Because I'd been building circuits with relays. Relays in series give you AND. Relays in parallel give you OR. So logic ICs were incredibly easy to use -- inputs and outputs are completely isolated. With relays, you could get feedback loops, and you had to work hard to prevent circuits from oscillating. With logic ICs, you just connect inputs -- they're all isolated. Very convenient."

"Beyond that, MSI chips like decoders -- you put in certain inputs and get a signal on just one specific output. Counters that increment with each pulse. To build a counter with relays would be enormously difficult. But it all fit into a 16-pin package. Combining them to accomplish a function was incredibly convenient."

"So there was PONTRON, I was shocked by it, and I started using ICs. I understood that this was how they put images on CRT screens. I thought, 'Ah, so that's how it works. Well then...' -- and from there, the Japanese talent for improvement kicked in."

### Mastering TV Signal Generation

**Sato:** "At first it was still black and white -- the world of 0s and 1s. But then I realized that by slightly varying the signal level, colors on screen got lighter or darker. Once I understood that, I could do grayscale processing. By doing these things, I could produce decent images. For the first time, I understood what 'using TV' meant. I learned how horizontal sync signals work, how vertical sync signals work."

"Then I could freely produce images. Gradually, instead of just simple squares, I wanted to express things like car shapes and characters. This also started with copying from Atari -- ROM existed. You store data in ROM -- pattern data -- and scan it vertically and horizontally, extracting dots to display on the CRT. By preparing many such images and selecting which one to display, the picture on screen changes. That's how images are produced."

"Eventually color TV became available to us. Processing RGB individually -- then colorful images appeared. Space Invaders was also black-and-white at first, then went to color. Color naturally consumes three times the data."

**Q:** Were the game machines outputting RGB?

**Sato:** "Yes, RGB. From the very beginning."

"If you encode and then decode, the image quality degrades. Fundamentally, when feeding into a CRT, it's RGB. So initially we used general-purpose TV monitors. But the encode/decode process made the picture dirty. As TV games grew in number, monitor manufacturers started producing dedicated gaming monitors, and they shipped in quantity."

**Q:** Around when was that?

**Sato:** "Around the heyday of arcade gaming, so around 1980. Panasonic and others were making them -- the volumes were significant enough for dedicated color arcade monitors."

## Joint Development with Panasonic

**Sato:** "Sega partnered with Panasonic. We made a game called 'Sub-Roc 3D' -- a submarine periscope game. For Panasonic, the monitors used in the game would be Panasonic monitors. Plus they probably thought the game industry looked profitable."

**Q:** "Sub-Roc 3D" is listed here -- released in 1982.

**Sato:** "They couldn't make games themselves -- that requires knowing what's fun and what isn't, all the planning work. But they could make circuit boards -- assemble ICs, test them. And it was a 3D game. The world's first 3D game -- doesn't it have some claim like that?"

**Q:** It says something about being the first stereoscopic video technology in game history. It was pseudo-3D, right?

**Sato:** "Right eye and left eye -- there's a disc, half opaque and half transparent, and you synchronize it. By peeping through the periscope, you see alternating images for each eye. When you fire, the target goes into the distance because the right and left eye images are slightly different, creating depth perception."

"At the time, I thought, 'Why do we have to work with Panasonic on this?' Their scheme was to sell monitors, make the boards, and supply them. I thought we could easily do it without Panasonic. But the people above me saw it differently -- partnering with Matsushita Electric [Panasonic] had tremendous external impact. 'You're working with Matsushita?' It was about politics beyond the technical matters. At the time, I genuinely didn't see the point."

"But later, on the same trajectory, Sega partnered with IBM to make a PC. That time I understood. Partnering with a big name has external appeal, and if the company is publicly traded, a front-page story in the Nikkei means the stock price goes up, which means paper profits increase. I gradually came to understand this. But at first, I thought, 'Why Panasonic? We don't need them. They're expensive. If we have a contractor make the boards, it's 50,000 yen. Buy from Panasonic, and it's 70,000-80,000. Why waste 20,000-30,000?' But later I understood there were benefits beyond that."

---

## Development of "Sega PONTRON"

**Q:** Just to confirm -- you personally developed PONTRON?

**Sato:** "PONTRON was an exact copy."

**Q:** You analyzed the circuits and replicated them?

**Sato:** "That's right. Back then, Atari was incredibly generous -- the circuit diagrams were included with every machine."

**Q:** Circuit diagrams were included?

**Sato:** "Attached to the machine. And of course there wasn't a board layout diagram, but it showed the board with IC numbers. We copied it entirely and renamed it 'Sega PONTRON.'"

"Honestly, it was a real shock at the time. More than that, it was incredibly fun. There had never been a game like that. Just a paddle bouncing a ball back and forth -- miss it and you lose a point -- and the speed gradually increases. Just that was enormously entertaining."

**Q:** Were there no patent issues?

**Sato:** "There might have been. But regarding patents... since our owner was David Rosen, a Jewish American, there may have been discussions on the American side. Something may have been worked out between the higher-ups."

---

## "Aggressive" Game Development

**Sato:** "After PONTRON, TV games became the mainstream. Almost all development projects shifted to using TV. TV games were easier to manage and incredibly flexible. With mechanical games, if you wanted to change the spacing of model cars, you had to physically rebuild things. But with circuits, if you wanted to add more cars, it wasn't that difficult. Speed could be adjusted freely. After building, it was just a board -- fewer breakdowns. So TV games kept advancing, and I lost count of how many types I personally made. More than ten, certainly."

### Rotating Monitors and Analog Tricks

**Sato:** "I did all sorts of crazy things. For driving games, the standard 4:3 TV orientation didn't give enough depth. So we'd set the monitor vertically."

**Q:** You set it vertically but swept the raster horizontally?

**Sato:** "Yes. We rotated the electron gun 90 degrees. By sweeping the shorter dimension, you had more control during the retrace period."

"One of my craziest creations was 'Road Race.'"

**Q:** Released February 1976, according to our records.

**Sato:** "For this one, on top of the rotated display, I used analog manipulation to shift where circles appeared on screen. This created road curves. Then another analog circuit made the road width gradually expand, creating perspective. You could create tight bends and unprecedented road dynamics. After 'Road Race' came 'Man TT' [motorcycle game] and others. The number of adjustment potentiometers in those machines was absurd -- the factory must have had a terrible time with calibration."

**Q:** That's not a normal way to use a TV.

**Sato:** "Not at all. But back then, the attitude was 'if it breaks, it breaks.' Put positively, it was very aggressive. Put negatively -- 'games only last two or three years anyway, so why design for five or ten years of life?'"

**Q:** If you adjusted the TV hardware that way, could that TV be used for other games?

**Sato:** "No. You'd basically throw it away. Back then, business was good. We kept putting out new games, and game centers were booming. Customers kept coming and spending money. The rule of thumb was that operators would recoup their investment in three months. After that, it was pure profit. Then they'd sell the machine on to smaller operators, who'd sell it further, until eventually the old machines ended up in China for parts salvage."

### The Arcade Machine Afterlife

**Sato:** "I saw it on TV once and was amazed -- they take a circuit board loaded with transistors, ICs, and microcomputers, and they dip it into a pot of molten solder. The components fall off and they sort them. There's a whole operation -- people sorting them by type, then selling them at market. What's garbage to us, they turn into a business. But that worked because components were discrete. Today, with everything integrated into a single microcomputer, even if you desolder it, it's useless without the software."

## Sega's Pinball Revolution

**Q:** Let me go back to the flipper [pinball] topic. Was "WINNER" Sega's first domestically produced pinball machine?

**Sato:** "WINNER was microcomputer-based. Before that was 'Carnival,' probably around 1975. Sega had a culture of being extremely aggressive -- trying anything."

**Sato:** "The American pinball manufacturers like Williams, Bally, and Midway had their machines, but I found them uninteresting. The balls were too slow. When you hit the flipper, the ball just lazily rolled to the bumpers."

"Williams' bumpers worked by sandwiching the ball and striking it from above when it triggered a switch. It wasn't very dynamic. So we said, 'If Sega is going to do this, let's make a completely different kind of pinball.' We redesigned the bumpers to strike balls outward when they tipped the mechanism. The ball speed was drastically faster."

"We made flippers stronger too. Then we added 'gimmicks' [yakumono] -- 3D elements. We attached a pachinko mechanism: accomplish something and a ball gets launched into a vertical pachinko section with different scoring paths. This transformed the flat 2D playing field into something three-dimensional."

"We made a machine called 'Sapporo' for the Sapporo Winter Olympics -- it had a slalom course where the ball was lifted up and dropped through ski gates. We added rails, magnets under the playfield to grab balls, roller accelerators that shot balls at high speed. We went wild. At peak, we had 'Wiggler Ball' systems with up to five balls in play at once."

"Then came 'Rodeo' -- the first machine to use a microcomputer. The CPU was the Intel 4040."

**Q:** You were using the Intel 4040?

**Sato:** "About a 20-pin microcomputer. It took me over a month to understand it. I grasped the ALU -- Arithmetic and Logic Unit -- and that results went into the accumulator. I understood input and output pins. But then what? The concept of programming was foreign to me."

---

## Understanding Microcomputers and Programming

**Sato:** "I decided the best way to learn was to build something myself. I took an 8080, set it up at home on a universal board with wrapping connectors, hooked up all the I/O, connected a keyboard bought from a junk shop, and actually programmed it. Only then did I finally understand what it was all about."

"Before CPUs came in chip form, there were microcomputer modules -- lunch-box-sized units packed with adder ICs and sequencing logic. We knew we had to master microcomputers. At first, Sega had someone else program for us -- an NEC subsidiary, I think. But one day the system completely stopped working. Turned out one wire had come loose. With random logic, if one part broke, other parts still worked. But with a program, if execution hits a disconnected wire, everything stops."

"That convinced me I had to master it myself. But once I understood microcomputers, doing everything in random logic seemed absurd."

### The Evolution from Relays to Microcomputers

**Sato:** "For me, the progression was: relays, then TTL ICs, then microcomputers. Each step was a revelation of convenience. When I joined, transistors were too expensive -- everything was relays. Then transistors became affordable. Then ICs appeared -- what took a massive relay array could be done with a few small chips. Then microcomputers -- changing speed or position, which had required rewiring, could now be done in software."

"Around that same time, gate arrays became available. The very first gate array at Sega was actually one I designed -- 550 gates."

**Q:** 550 gates?

**Sato:** "550 gates -- enough for about six MSI functions. It cost hundreds of thousands of yen. And the first one didn't work. I'd changed some logic from active-low to active-high during design but forgot to update the board. Once I fixed that mismatch, it worked fine. But that was only 550 gates."

"Now we have FPGAs -- field-programmable gate arrays with probably three million gates or more. Back then, gate arrays used masks -- once fabricated, you couldn't change them. A mistake meant starting over. The 4040 ran at maybe 500-600 kilohertz. The 8080 went to 2 megahertz. The Z80 B-type reached 4 megahertz. Compare that to today's PCs running at multiple gigahertz."

### Memory Economics in Arcade vs. Consumer

**Sato:** "Memory was fantastically expensive. The RAM in Space Invaders was 64 kilobits -- 8 kilobytes -- and one chip cost thousands of yen. Today, 64 gigabytes of flash memory costs a few hundred yen."

"For consumer games, we initially used mask ROM. EPROM was outrageously expensive -- an Intel 27-series 256-kilobit chip might cost 4,000 yen. For 'Hang-On' -- Sega's first body-sensation [taikan] game -- we used 26 EPROM chips. Twenty-six! Just the EPROMs alone cost over 100,000 yen per unit. We sold thousands. Intel was astounded."

"But 'Hang-On' was selling at about 2 million yen per unit, so spending 100,000-200,000 on EPROMs to ship immediately -- rather than waiting two months for mask ROMs -- was worth it. Time-to-market mattered more."

"For consumer products, though, volumes were completely different. If ROM costs were 1,000 yen higher per unit, at 10,000 units that's 10 million yen; at 100,000 units, it's 100 million yen. So mask ROM was essential. You had to order from the semiconductor maker by October or November to make the Christmas shopping season."
