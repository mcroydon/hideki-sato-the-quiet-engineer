## Saturn Architecture

The Saturn used dual Hitachi SH-2 CPUs. Sato chose a sprite-based architecture rather than polygon-based, partly to accommodate existing software teams.

**Sato on Kutaragi (PlayStation creator):** "Kutaragi and I are the same age -- he's 2-3 months older. We had a friendly personal relationship and dined together regularly. He once told me frankly: 'You can't beat me. Sony has its own factories, its own semiconductor capability. You're relying on suppliers. The only way to compete is if both companies are on equal footing -- and they're not.'"

## Saturn's Fatal Flaw: No SDK

**Sato:** "The biggest problem was having virtually no libraries for the new hardware. What we gave developers as 'libraries' was really just portions of application software. We got absolutely hammered by third-party developers."

**On why:** "There was no mindset for it. Our software teams could figure things out on their own. But for home consoles, the most important thing is third parties."

## The Dreamcast Architecture War

A parallel development competition between Japanese and American teams for Dreamcast's architecture became one of the most dramatic episodes:

- **Japan team:** Hitachi SH-4 CPU, NEC graphics (VideoLogic tile architecture), Yamaha sound
- **America team:** Mainstream CPU, 3dfx graphics, E-mu sound

**Sato on incentive structures:** "The American team prioritized goals with bonuses: Priority #1: Cost ($3,000 bonus). #2: Performance ($2,000). So they'd cut anything that raised cost even if it improved performance. The Japanese engineers had no bonuses -- just salary. But they'd agonize over every tradeoff: 'This adds 200 yen but gives 20% more polygons.' I'd say: 'Do it.'"

**The "Imperial Conference":** "Eventually there was a showdown meeting. Irimajiri had lobbied everyone -- most of the company was on his side. He was president; I was just a managing director. I thought I had a 95% chance of losing."

**Sato:** "But then something unexpected emerged: the president of Sega of America had been receiving stock from 3dfx. That was part of why he'd been pushing their architecture."

**Okawa's decisive reasoning:** "'Sato has failed many times -- 8-bit, Saturn, many failures. So he must have learned many things. Therefore, he probably won't fail this time.' That's how it was decided."

**Aftermath with Irimajiri:** "Irimajiri said: 'This company is crazy. How did your proposal win?' I told him: 'Why did you, as president, come down to my level to argue about hardware specs? That's not your job. Because you descended to my level, I won -- I have more battle experience.'"

## NEC Yield Problems and Launch

NEC's graphics chip had terrible manufacturing yields, leading to immediate inventory shortages at launch.

**Sato:** "And as usual -- terrible launch software. 'Pen Pen TriIcelon,' 'Godzilla Generations' -- absolutely appalling."

## Internet and the ACCESS Browser

Microsoft's browser effort was "half-hearted." Sato went to ACCESS and paid about 50 million yen in development fees. The ACCESS browser shipped with Dreamcast.

**Sato on showing Okawa the internet:** "I connected the Dreamcast to a large TV in his office and showed him adult websites. He needed to understand the risk. His reaction: 'Well, it can't be helped. We'll put in some parental controls, but it's the internet.'"

## Okawa Discovers Financial Irregularities

**Sato:** "Okawa discovered massive loans to subsidiaries -- 35 billion yen to Sega of America, 20-something billion to Europe. Under standalone accounting, the lending looked like assets and subsidiary purchases looked like revenue. When Okawa figured this out, he was furious. Nakayama was removed as president."

## The Transition to Software

In 2000, Sega announced it would become an "architecture holder" -- deliberately vague code for exiting hardware. Around February 2001, the real announcement came. Okawa died March 16, 2001.

**Sato:** "Since 1983, I'd been doing consumer hardware. To have given birth to and raised these products, only to be the one to bury them... That was the end."

## The "Open Ocean" Illusion

**Sato:** "Many at Sega believed that on PlayStation and Nintendo, our games would sell like crazy. What actually happened: we brought Virtua Fighter to market and Tekken was already there. Going into the open ocean, we discovered it was full of sharks."
