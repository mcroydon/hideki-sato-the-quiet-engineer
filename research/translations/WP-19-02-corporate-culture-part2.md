## Copy Protection Wars

**Sato:** "I built numerous copy protection systems -- even custom microprocessors. Every time, pirates would crack them within two weeks. I'd get screamed at by the president."

"Once I got praised -- the new security chip was holding up. The president said, 'Looks like this one's good. Finally.' The next day: 'You idiot, it's been cracked!' The pirates found the security bit through binary search -- masking half the chip with UV-blocking material, erasing, checking if it still worked, halving again."

"But through all those failures, I was never demoted or had my pay cut. The president would yell, 'Get a buzzcut!' and the next day it was forgotten. That's the kind of culture the game industry needs."

The pirates' technique for defeating copy protection was methodical: they would physically mask half the chip die with UV-blocking material, expose the other half to UV erasure, and then test whether the chip still functioned. By repeating this binary search process -- halving the exposed area each time -- they could rapidly identify and neutralize the specific security bit, no matter where it was located on the chip.

## The TeraDrive/IBM Disaster

**Sato:** "The TeraDrive was a massive failure -- about 5-6 billion yen in contractual obligations to IBM. We contracted to buy 1 million copies of the DOS/V OS; we made about 1,000 units. The resolution was: 'We'll use IBM's POWER PC for the next system.'"

The TeraDrive was a hybrid PC/Mega Drive system that Sega developed in partnership with IBM. The scale of the contractual mismatch -- 1 million OS licenses purchased versus approximately 1,000 units manufactured -- represented one of the most costly miscalculations in Sega's history. The resolution of the dispute by committing to use IBM's PowerPC architecture in a future system illustrates how large contractual obligations from failed products could constrain future hardware decisions.

## Kura Sushi and Dreamcast Applications

After the Dreamcast was discontinued as a consumer gaming platform, Sega attempted to repurpose the hardware for commercial applications. Dreamcast hardware was adapted for use in Kura Sushi's restaurant ordering system. However, the project failed because vinegar from the sushi environment corroded the GD-ROM disc mechanisms.

Surplus Dreamcast chips -- approximately 1.5 million units -- were sold to Sammy Corporation for use in pachislot (pachinko slot) machines, notably the "Fist of the North Star" (Hokuto no Ken) machine. This represented a practical solution for recovering value from the excess semiconductor inventory left over from the Dreamcast's discontinuation.

## Saturn SDK Lessons Applied to Dreamcast

**Sato:** "Learning from Saturn's mistakes, we produced a very good SDK for Dreamcast. Skilled third parties could get images on screen in about three hours with the new kit. With Saturn, the same thing had taken about a week."

The Saturn's lack of proper development tools and libraries had been identified as one of its most critical failures. When third-party developers received the Saturn hardware, what Sega provided as "libraries" was really just portions of application software. Developers were left to figure out the hardware on their own, which was feasible for Sega's internal teams who had intimate hardware knowledge, but was a devastating barrier for third-party studios.

For the Dreamcast, Sato ensured that a comprehensive, well-documented SDK was produced from the outset. The dramatic improvement -- from approximately one week to get first images on screen with Saturn, down to approximately three hours with Dreamcast -- represented the practical application of one of the most painful lessons from the Saturn era.

## Sega's "One and Done" Culture

**Sato:** "We gave good hints to others but couldn't turn anything into real products ourselves. The dot-eating game concept (Head On at Gremlin) preceded Pac-Man, but we didn't iterate or protect it. We were always chasing the next new thing."

This observation about Sega's corporate culture reveals a pattern that recurred throughout the company's history. Sega frequently pioneered concepts and technologies that competitors subsequently refined and commercialized more successfully. The dot-eating game mechanic that appeared in Gremlin's Head On (which Sega owned through its acquisition of Gremlin Industries) predated Namco's Pac-Man, but Sega did not iterate on or protect the concept. Instead, the company moved on to the next innovation, leaving the commercial exploitation to others.

## Risk-Taking and Decision-Making

**Sato:** "What the game industry needs is people who can make gut decisions and accept failure. In the old days, every game company had a strong-willed, autocratic leader. They'd say 'Do this!' Out of 10 bets, 7 would fail and 2-3 would hit. But decisions were made in a day."

"Today's Sega is all meetings. 'Is this profitable? Show me the competitor analysis.' By the time they're done, a year has passed. People are making PowerPoints instead of making games."

"Hit products are things that 9 out of 10 people oppose. Things everyone agrees on don't become hits."

Sato's critique of modern corporate decision-making in the game industry reflects a fundamental tension between risk management and creative innovation. The historical model he describes -- autocratic leaders making rapid gut decisions, accepting a high failure rate in exchange for speed and occasional breakthrough hits -- contrasts sharply with the committee-driven, analysis-heavy approach that came to dominate as game companies grew larger and became publicly traded.

His observation that consensus products rarely become hits encapsulates a paradox familiar in creative industries: the very process of building organizational agreement tends to sand down the distinctive edges that make products remarkable.

## Why Japanese Games Conquered the World

**Sato:** "Within severe constraints -- limited semiconductor memory -- how do you delight players? That's something Japanese people are naturally good at. In a cramped space, finding just a little room. Packed trains, a small country -- the way of thinking, the environment you grow up in. When you need to create enjoyable experiences within limited capacity, you trim here, cut there, and maximize total performance."

"But now that memory is effectively unlimited, it's getting dangerous for Japan."

Sato's theory connects Japan's dominance in the early video game era to a broader cultural aptitude for optimization under constraints. He argues that growing up in a physically constrained environment -- small living spaces, crowded public transportation, limited land area -- cultivated a cognitive style particularly well-suited to the engineering challenges of early game hardware, where extremely limited memory and processing power required constant creative compromise and prioritization.

His warning about the implications of removing those constraints suggests that as hardware became more powerful and memory effectively unlimited, the specific cultural advantage that had powered Japan's game industry dominance was being neutralized. When the challenge shifts from "maximize within constraints" to "fill unlimited space with content," different skills and organizational structures become advantageous.

## Industry Decline and Changing Preferences

**Sato:** "The shift in how people spend time -- from arcades and consoles to smartphones and social communication -- is fundamental, not cyclical. The people who used to go to game centers now find it more interesting to interact with other humans online."

Sato characterizes the migration of players away from traditional gaming venues and dedicated gaming hardware as a structural transformation rather than a temporary downturn. The core insight is that gaming had historically competed for leisure time against other passive or solitary activities, but the rise of smartphones and social media introduced a fundamentally different competitor: real-time human connection. The social dimension of online interaction proved more compelling to many former gamers than the increasingly sophisticated but ultimately artificial experiences offered by dedicated gaming hardware.
