## Advisory: Stolar Quote Presentation

**Lines 159 and footnote [46]:** The body text presents "The Saturn is not our future" as Stolar's "most famous — or infamous — statement." The footnote [46] then says his "most commonly quoted statement upon joining Sega was: 'We have to kill the Saturn.'"

Both quotes are verified as real:
- "The Saturn is not our future" — said at E3 1997 (confirmed via web search)
- "We have to kill the Saturn" — said upon joining Sega/in interviews (confirmed via web search; Wikipedia)

**Issue:** The body text and footnote present different quotes as his signature statement, which could confuse readers. This is a presentational inconsistency rather than a factual error. Both quotes are authentic. No correction applied, but the author may wish to clarify in revision that Stolar made both statements at different times.

## Notes
- The $100 per-unit Saturn loss (line 183) is correctly stated, matching all research sources.
- The chapter's presentation of the SOJ-SOA conflict is well-supported by multiple independent sources.
- Saturn outselling Mega Drive in Japan (5.75M vs 3.58M) is correctly noted on line 165.
