## Corrections Applied

### 1. CES 1991 Date: "June 1991" → "late May 1991"
- **Location:** Line 31
- **Original:** "At the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991"
- **Corrected:** "At the Consumer Electronics Show in late May 1991"
- **Rationale:** Sony announced its Nintendo partnership on May 28, 1991. Nintendo announced the Philips deal the following morning (~May 29 or June 1, depending on source). Chapter 9 of this book uses "May 1991" for the same event. Most sources cite the CES as occurring in late May/early June 1991. "Late May 1991" is both more accurate for the Sony announcement and consistent with Chapter 9.
- **Sources:** Web search (multiple sources confirm May 28, 1991); "Super NES CD-ROM," Wikipedia; Chapter 9 of this book (line 41)

### 2. Howard Lincoln's Title: "Nintendo chairman" → "chairman of Nintendo of America"
- **Location:** Line 31
- **Original:** "Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln"
- **Corrected:** "Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America"
- **Rationale:** Howard Lincoln was chairman of Nintendo of America (NOA), not of Nintendo Co., Ltd. as a whole. Hiroshi Yamauchi was president of Nintendo Co., Ltd. during this period. The distinction matters for accuracy about who held authority in the Nintendo corporate structure.
- **Sources:** "Howard Lincoln," Wikipedia; web search confirmation

### 3. Saturn Per-Unit Loss: "$80" → "$100"
- **Location:** Line 107
- **Original:** "roughly $80 at contemporary exchange rates"
- **Corrected:** "roughly $100 at contemporary exchange rates"
- **Rationale:** The research document (sega-consoles-technical.md) states ¥10,000 loss per unit ≈ ~$100. At 1994-1995 exchange rates (¥94-102 per dollar), ¥10,000 = approximately $98-$106. Chapter 11 of this book correctly states "$100." Chapter 10 also correctly states "$100." The "$80" figure in Chapter 12 was inconsistent with all other sources.
- **Sources:** research/sega-consoles-technical.md; research/sega-corporate-history.md; Mega Drive Shock financial analysis; Chapters 10 and 11 of this book

## Advisory (No Correction Applied)

### Panzer Dragoon Saga: "30,000 copies"
- **Location:** Line 121
- **Current text:** "only 30,000 copies were shipped to North America"
- **Issue:** The initial production run for North America was reportedly ~20,000 copies, with some additional copies produced later. The 30,000 figure is plausible as a cumulative total but is disputed. Some sources cite 20,000-30,000 as a range.
- **Recommendation:** The author may wish to qualify as "approximately 20,000-30,000 copies" or "fewer than 30,000 copies." However, footnote [47] uses vague language ("extremely limited distribution") rather than citing a specific number, which provides some cover. No correction applied as the figure falls within the commonly cited range and the footnote is appropriately hedged.
- **Sources:** Web search; "Sega Saturn," Wikipedia
