# Fact-Check Log: Chapter 18 — The Quiet Engineer

## Summary
**Status: PASS WITH NOTE — No definitive errors, one advisory note on Genesis sales figure.**

All major claims verified. One footnote uses a high-end estimate for Genesis sales that exceeds well-documented figures.

## Advisory Note

### Genesis/Mega Drive Sales Figure (Footnote 54)
- **Claim**: "the Genesis/Mega Drive's approximately 40 million (including licensed variants)"
- **Documented figures**: Official Sega-manufactured units: 30.75 million. Tectoy (Brazil): ~3 million. Majesco (US): projected 1.5 million. Samsung (Korea) and others: undocumented small numbers. Total documented: ~35-36 million.
- **Assessment**: The "approximately 40 million" figure appears in some sources but exceeds well-documented totals by several million. Some sources cite it without specifying methodology.
- **Action**: No change applied. The body text claim that "the SNES ultimately outsold the Genesis worldwide" is correct regardless (49.1M vs 30.75-40M). The footnote's "including licensed variants" qualifier provides appropriate context. Flagged as high-end estimate.
