## Notes
- The "May 1991" CES date is accurate for the Sony announcement (May 28, 1991). Chapter 12 uses "June 1991" for the same event — this inconsistency is flagged in the Chapter 12 fact-check log.
- The chapter correctly identifies CES as being "in Chicago" — the Summer CES 1991 was indeed held in Chicago.
- Kutaragi's SPC700 story and the Nintendo betrayal are well-documented and accurately presented.
