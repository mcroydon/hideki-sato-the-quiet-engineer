### Nintendo Lockout Chip

**Claim #24: 10NES: "two games per year" limit** -- CORRECTION NEEDED
- INCORRECT. The widely documented limit was **five games per year**, not two. Multiple sources confirm the five-game limit, including Wikipedia's NES article, the Atari Games v. Nintendo case documents, and numerous gaming history sources. Companies like Konami famously created subsidiary labels (Ultra Games) to circumvent the five-game limit. The chapter should be corrected from "two" to "five."
- Sources: Wikipedia NES; Video Game Sage forums; Bootleg Games Wiki; ResetEra discussion of Konami/Ultra Games.

**Claim #25: "Nintendo was the sole manufacturer of all cartridges"**
- VERIFIED. Nintendo manufactured all authorized NES cartridges, requiring publishers to pay upfront. Sources: Wikipedia CIC (Nintendo); Medium article on Nintendo Seal of Quality.

**Claim #26: "Cartridges could not be returned"**
- VERIFIED. Publishers bore all inventory risk; cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo. Sources: Wikipedia CIC (Nintendo); research files.

### Games

**Claim #27: Alex Kidd in Miracle World: "1986"**
- VERIFIED. Released November 1, 1986, in Japan. Sources: Wikipedia Alex Kidd in Miracle World; IMDB.

**Claim #28: Phantasy Star: "1987", "4 Mbit cartridge", female protagonist**
- VERIFIED. Released December 20, 1987, in Japan. Used a 4 Mbit (512 KB) cartridge. Featured Alis Landale as a female protagonist -- noted as the first female protagonist in a Japanese RPG. Sources: Wikipedia Phantasy Star; Phantasy Star Wiki.

### Sato-Specific Claims

**Claim #29: SG-1000 sold "160,000 units"**
- VERIFIED. The SG-1000 sold 160,000 units in 1983, exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000. Sources: Wikipedia SG-1000; Shmuplations interview; research files.

**Claim #30: "Console Fever" quote**
- VERIFIED against research. Sato's quote: "It was a scale completely incomparable with our arcade board sales. And that is how our entire company caught Console Fever." From the 1998 Famitsu DC interview (Shmuplations translation). Sources: Shmuplations; research files.

**Claim #31: Sato as Mark III "lead"**
- VERIFIED (with nuance). The chapter describes Sato as leading the Mark III development, and research files confirm he "led the design of the custom VDP that was the Mark III's key differentiator." Multiple sources describe him as driving the decision to create custom silicon. Sources: Shmuplations; Sega-16; research files.

**Claim #32: Tom Kalinske: "former Mattel president", hired by SOA "in 1990" (footnote says "mid-1990")**
- VERIFIED. Kalinske was CEO of Mattel from 1985 to 1987 (making "former Mattel president" accurate -- though his exact title was CEO/president). He joined Sega of America in 1990, with some sources specifying November 1990. The chapter text says the hiring was "in 1990" and footnote 58 says "mid-1990" -- the November date would make "late 1990" more accurate than "mid-1990," but this is a minor imprecision. Sources: Wikipedia Tom Kalinske; Sega-16 interview.

### Other Claims

**Claim #33: NES color palette described as "sixteen" colors** -- CORRECTION NEEDED
- INCORRECT. This is the most significant factual error in the chapter. The chapter states: "Its color palette of sixty-four colors was four times larger than the NES's sixteen." This is wrong.

  The NES/Famicom PPU (2C02) has a **total hardware palette of approximately 54 unique colors** (from 64 addressable color values, with some duplicates). It can display **25 colors simultaneously** on screen (13 background + 12 sprite colors). With color emphasis bits, the palette extends to 448 possible color variations.

  The "sixteen" figure appears to be a confusion with the TMS9918A's 16-color fixed palette (used in the SG-1000, not the NES). The NES uses a completely different color generation system.

  **The correct comparison should be:** The Master System's palette of 64 colors compared to the NES's palette of approximately 54 colors -- a modest advantage, not a "four times larger" one. The Master System's advantage was more significant in simultaneous on-screen colors: 32 vs. the NES's 25.

  The chapter text and footnote 27 both need correction.
  Sources: NESdev Wiki PPU palettes; Wikipedia List of video game console palettes; Copetti NES Architecture.

**Claim #34: DX7 synthesizer connection to FM synthesis**
- VERIFIED (with nuance). The YM2413 OPLL and the DX7 both use Yamaha's FM synthesis technology, licensed from John Chowning's Stanford research. However, they are quite different implementations: the DX7 uses the YM21290/YM21280 chips with 6 operators per voice, while the YM2413 is a cost-reduced OPL variant with only 2 operators per channel and mostly fixed instrument patches. The chapter's statement that this was "the same FM synthesis technology" is broadly correct at the conceptual level, though the implementations differ substantially. The connection is fair for a general-audience biography.

**Claim #35: Mega Drive captured "65 percent of the European console market"**
- VERIFIED. Multiple sources confirm the Mega Drive captured 65% of the European console market during the 16-bit era. Sources: Wikipedia Sega Genesis; research files.

**Claim #36: Mega Drive Japan sales: "3.58 million", Super Famicom Japan: "17 million"**
- PARTIALLY VERIFIED. The Mega Drive's 3.58 million Japanese sales figure is confirmed. The Super Famicom sold 17.17 million units in Japan, so "17 million" is a reasonable rounding. However, note that the chapter text (in the closing section) says the NES sold "62 million" worldwide while Sega sold "13 million" -- these are both correct as rough figures. Sources: Wikipedia Sega Genesis; Wikipedia SNES.

## Claims Not Requiring Correction (But Worth Noting)

- **Tom Kalinske timing (Claim #32):** Footnote 58 says "mid-1990" but some sources say November 1990. This is a minor imprecision but not clearly wrong -- "mid-1990" could refer to the middle of the calendar year rather than November. Left as-is but flagged for author review.

- **Super Famicom Japan sales (Claim #36):** Chapter says "17 million"; actual figure is 17.17 million. The rounding is reasonable. Left as-is.

- **Mega Drive Europe 5.73 million vs. NES 7.26 million:** The chapter claims the Master System's 6.25 million European installed base "exceeded the Mega Drive's European installed base of 5.73 million." This is correct per the 1993 data. However, the chapter does not mention that the NES's European installed base (7.26 million) was still larger than the Master System's. This is not an error of fact but an omission that could mislead. Flagged for author awareness.
