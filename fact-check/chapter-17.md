# Fact-Check Log: Chapter 17 — After the Consoles

## Summary
**Status: CORRECTIONS REQUIRED — Three factual errors found and fixed.**

Three errors identified: (1) Sato's age at Feb 2003 press conference, (2) fiscal year date, (3) Atlus acquisition date.

## Errors Found and Corrected

### 1. Sato's Age at February 2003 Press Conference (Line 7)
- **Claim**: "Sato, sixty-four years old"
- **Correct**: "Sato, fifty-four years old"
- **Reasoning**: Sato was born November 5, 1948 (confirmed by obituaries reporting age 77 at death on February 13, 2026). In February 2003, he was 54 years old.
- **Source**: Multiple obituaries (Kotaku, GAM3S.GG, sportskeeda, PC Gamer) confirm age 77 at death Feb 13, 2026, consistent with 1948 birth year. If born Nov 5, 1948, he was 54 in Feb 2003.
- **Action**: Changed "sixty-four years old" → "fifty-four years old"

### 2. Fiscal Year Date (Line 25)
- **Claim**: "The fiscal year ending March 2001 showed a group net loss of seventeen billion eight hundred thirty million yen — a staggering number, though actually an improvement over the previous year's loss of fifty-one billion seven hundred thirty million."
- **Correct**: The ¥17.83 billion loss was for fiscal year ending March **2002** (FY2001), not March 2001. The ¥51.73 billion loss was for fiscal year ending March **2001** (FY2000).
- **Source**: Sega Annual Report 2002; Chapter 16 footnote 42 correctly attributes the ¥17.83B loss to "fiscal 2001 results" (i.e., FY ending March 2002) at the May 2002 press conference. Wikipedia Sega article; Dreamcast article.
- **Action**: Changed "The fiscal year ending March 2001" → "The fiscal year ending March 2002"

### 3. Atlus Acquisition Date (Line 85)
- **Claim**: "Sega's 2020 acquisition of Atlus"
- **Correct**: Sega Sammy acquired Index Corporation (Atlus's parent company) in September 2013, with the transfer completed November 1, 2013.
- **Source**: Wikipedia Atlus article; ResetEra "10 years ago today" thread (2023); Game Developer; Nintendo Life; NeoGAF.
- **Action**: Changed "Sega's 2020 acquisition of Atlus" → "Sega's 2013 acquisition of Atlus"
