## Notes
- The $100 per-unit loss figure is correctly stated here (line 179/footnote 49), consistent with research. Chapter 12 incorrectly states "$80" — see Chapter 12 fact-check log.
- The Game Boy vs. Game Gear comparison (118M vs. 10M) is confirmed and effectively illustrates the "withered technology" principle.
- Technical analogies (kitchen/chefs, house/pool, Swiss Army knife) are editorial choices and not subject to fact-checking, but the underlying technical claims they illustrate are accurate.
