## Summary of Findings

Of 20+ claims checked, most are substantively accurate. Several require correction or clarification:

- **Slot machine ban date**: The chapter says "1952" but the Johnson Act was enacted January 2, 1951. CORRECTION NEEDED.
- **Nakayama birth date in footnote**: The research doc footnote says "March 21, 1932" but multiple sources confirm **May 21, 1932**. CORRECTION NEEDED.
- **"Rosen -- by then the sole controlling owner"**: Contradicted within the same chapter by the statement that Bromley and Stewart sold their 80%. CLARIFICATION NEEDED.
- **Income Doubling Plan**: Chapter body says "announced in 1960" -- acceptable but imprecise. Footnote correctly says "December 1960." NO CORRECTION NEEDED in body (the plan was publicly discussed starting in fall 1960), but the footnote date is more precise.
- **Periscope as "first original Sega game"**: Broadly accepted, but there is a scholarly dispute with Namco's 1965 "Torpedo Launcher." The chapter's claim reflects the standard account. NOTE ONLY.

## Claim-by-Claim Verification

### 1. Standard Games founding (May 1940, Honolulu, Bromley/Bromberg/Humpert)

**Chapter says:** "In May 1940, three American businessmen -- Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and their associate James Humpert -- incorporated a company called Standard Games in Honolulu, Hawaii."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (History of Sega), Britannica Money, They Create Worlds blog, and multiple other sources confirm May 1940, Honolulu, with these three founders. Some sources describe Humpert as a "family friend" rather than "associate," but the substance is correct.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 2. Slot machine ban: "US government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1952"

**Chapter says (footnote 6):** "The U.S. government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1952."

**Verification:** INCORRECT DATE. The Johnson Act (Transportation of Gambling Devices Act) was enacted on **January 2, 1951**, not 1952. The Act prohibited the transportation of gambling devices (including slot machines) to states where they were illegal, as well as their manufacture, possession, use, sale, or transportation in D.C. and U.S. possessions. The Wikipedia "History of Sega" article says "1952" but this appears to be an imprecise attribution -- the law was passed in 1951 and its enforcement and effects on military bases rolled out over subsequent months. Various Sega history sources round to "1952" because that is when the operational impact was felt (and when Bromley dispatched employees to Japan), but the legislation itself was enacted in 1951.

**Sources:** Johnson Act text (govinfo.gov, 64 Stat. 1134, January 2, 1951); NIGC.gov; Stop Predatory Gambling; NPR (2022) on military slot machines.

**Verdict:** NEEDS CORRECTION. The chapter should either say "1951" (the year the law was enacted) or clarify that while the Johnson Act was passed in 1951, its practical effects prompted Bromley to shift operations overseas by 1952. The current phrasing "in 1952" is misleading.

**Recommended fix:** Change "in 1952" to "in 1951" with a footnote noting the operational impact was felt in 1952.

---

### 3. Service Games of Japan: established February 15, 1952

**Chapter says:** "On February 15, 1952, Bromley dispatched two employees -- Richard Stewart and Ray LeMaire -- to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (History of Sega), Abort Retry Fail, and multiple sources confirm February 15, 1952 as the date Service Games opened a distribution office in Tokyo. The timing aligns with the slot machine ban: the Johnson Act was enacted January 2, 1951, and Bromley responded by expanding to Japan.

**Note on names:** The chapter calls Stewart "Richard Stewart." Multiple authoritative sources (Wikipedia Sega article, They Create Worlds blog based on primary research) confirm the name as **Richard Stewart** (sometimes called "Dick Stewart"). Some sources confuse him with "Raymond" but Richard/Dick is correct.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 4. Service Games Panama: "all five partners"

**Chapter says (footnote 8):** "Service Games Panama was established by all five partners."

**Chapter body says:** "Within a year, the five partners formalized their international structure by establishing Service Games Panama as a holding company."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. The They Create Worlds blog, citing primary documents, confirms Service Games Panama was formed in September 1953 with five equal partners (200 shares each): Irving Bromberg, Martin Bromley, Richard (Dick) Stewart, Raymond LeMaire, and James Humpert. Irving Bromberg was president; Dick Stewart was general manager.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. The five partners are the original three Standard Games founders (Bromley, Bromberg, Humpert) plus the two dispatched to Japan (Stewart, LeMaire). No correction needed.

---

### 5. Service Games dissolution: May 31, 1960

**Chapter says:** "On May 31, 1960, Service Games of Japan was dissolved."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (History of Sega), Sega Wikipedia article, Abort Retry Fail, and multiple sources confirm this exact date.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 6. Nihon Goraku Bussan: founded June 3, 1960

**Chapter says:** "Three days later, on June 3, Bromley established two new companies to continue the business: Nihon Goraku Bussan ... and Nihon Kikai Seizo."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (History of Sega), Sega Wikipedia article, and multiple sources confirm June 3, 1960.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 7. SEGA name origin: SE from Service, GA from Games

**Chapter says:** "Take the first two letters of 'Service.' Take the first two letters of 'Games.' You get SEGA."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (David Rosen), Sega Wikipedia article, and virtually all Sega history sources confirm this etymology: SE(rvice) GA(mes).

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 8. David Rosen: Air Force, returned to Japan 1954, founded Rosen Enterprises

**Chapter says:** "David Rosen grew up in Brooklyn, served in the United States Air Force, and was stationed in Japan during the postwar occupation."

**Chapter says:** "In 1954, Rosen returned to Japan and started Rosen Enterprises."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (David Rosen) confirms: served in the United States Air Force (1948-1952); returned to Japan in 1954; founded Rosen Enterprises, Inc. Born January 22, 1930.

**Additional context not in chapter:** David Rosen died December 25, 2025, at age 95 (confirmed by Time Extension, PC Gamer, SEGAbits, and multiple obituaries). The footnotes mention this death date, which is accurate.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 9. Rosen Enterprises importing coin-ops: 1957

**Chapter says:** "By 1957, Rosen had found his real calling. He began importing coin-operated amusement machines."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (David Rosen) states: "In 1957, Rosen Enterprises, Ltd. shifted its focus and pioneered the importation and operation of coin-op amusement machines."

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 10. Merger creating Sega Enterprises: 1965; Rosen became "chairman and chief executive officer"

**Chapter says:** "In 1965, the inevitable happened: the two companies merged. ... David Rosen became chairman and chief executive officer."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (David Rosen), Wikipedia (Sega), and multiple sources confirm the 1965 merger and Rosen's title as chairman and CEO.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 11. Periscope: 1966, first original Sega game, 25-cent play

**Chapter says:** "The first proof of concept came in 1966, when Sega created Periscope, its first original game."

**Chapter says:** "Its success was so pronounced that it prompted operators to raise the standard price of play from ten cents to twenty-five cents."

**Verification:** MOSTLY CONFIRMED, with nuance.

- **1966 date:** Confirmed. Sega released Periscope in Japan in 1966.
- **"First original Sega game":** This is the standard account in most Sega histories. However, Gaming Alexandria and other researchers note that Namco's Masaya Nakamura claimed he built a similar game called "Torpedo Launcher" in 1965. The relationship between the Namco and Sega versions is disputed. The chapter's claim reflects the mainstream historical account.
- **25-cent play:** Confirmed. However, the price change was specifically associated with Sega's 1968 single-player redesign for export, not the 1966 original Japanese release. The chapter implies the 25-cent pricing happened immediately, but it was more of a 1968 development.
- **"First Japanese-made arcade export":** The chapter calls it "the first Japanese-made arcade export," which is confirmed by multiple sources (Wikipedia, Sega Wiki, etc.).

**Verdict:** SUBSTANTIALLY ACCURATE. The 25-cent pricing timeline could be slightly more precise (1968 for the export version, not 1966 for the original Japanese release), but the chapter does not specify a year for the pricing change, so it is not strictly wrong.

### 12. Gulf and Western sale: 1969, "$10 million" for 80% stake

**Chapter says:** "In 1969, Rosen -- by then the sole controlling owner of Sega -- sold the company to Gulf and Western Industries. ... The price was $10 million for the 80 percent stake held by Bromley and Stewart, while LeMaire retained his 20 percent."

**Verification:** The financial details are CONFIRMED. They Create Worlds (citing primary documents) gives the price as $9,977,043 for 80% of stock, between June 1969 and January 1970. LeMaire retained 20%.

**However, there is a logical contradiction in the chapter.** The chapter says both:
1. "Rosen -- by then the sole controlling owner of Sega" (line 65)
2. "The price was $10 million for the 80 percent stake held by Bromley and Stewart" (line 67)

If Rosen was the "sole controlling owner," then Bromley and Stewart could not have sold their 80%. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously.

**What actually happened:** Multiple Wikipedia sources use the phrase "Rosen, by then the sole owner" but then describe Bromley and Stewart selling 80%. This appears to be an internal contradiction present in the Wikipedia sources themselves. The They Create Worlds blog (which does primary research from corporate documents) indicates that Bromley, Stewart, Rosen, and LeMaire all held shares at the time of the sale. The most likely reading is that Rosen was the de facto operational leader (sole controlling executive) but not the sole owner of shares. The characterization of Rosen as "sole owner" in some sources appears to be inaccurate or imprecise -- he may have been the sole *managing* owner or had acquired majority operational control.

**Verdict:** CONTRADICTION NEEDS CORRECTION. The chapter should not call Rosen "the sole controlling owner" since it goes on to describe Bromley and Stewart selling 80%. The recommended fix is to remove "sole controlling owner" and instead describe Rosen as the chief executive or operational leader.

### 13. Revenue figures: $37M (1979), $150M (1981), $215M (1982), $136M (1983)

**Chapter says:** "Revenue grew from $37 million in 1979 to $150 million in 1981 and nearly $215 million in 1982. ... Sega's revenue plummeted to $136 million in 1983."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. FundingUniverse (History of Sega of America) provides these exact figures. The $37 million for 1979 is confirmed. $150 million for 1981 is confirmed. "$215 million" for 1982 (described as "nearly $215 million") aligns with the $214 million reported elsewhere. $136 million for 1983 is confirmed.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 14. Nakayama: "Born in 1932", "jukebox repair technician"

**Chapter body says:** "Born in 1932, he had started his career in the amusement industry not in a boardroom but on his knees, as a jukebox repair technician."

**Chapter footnote 27 says:** "Hayao Nakayama (born March 21, 1932)."

**Verification:**

- **Birth year 1932:** CONFIRMED. Multiple sources confirm 1932.
- **Exact date:** The footnote says "March 21, 1932." Wikipedia (Hayao Nakayama), Grokipedia, Prabook, and multiple other sources say **May 21, 1932**. The "March 21" in the footnote appears to be a transcription error (the research document also says "March 21" but this appears to be incorrect).
- **"Jukebox repair technician":** PARTIALLY CONFIRMED, with nuance. Wikipedia says he "began his career as a jukebox repair technician." However, the Grokipedia article provides more detail: Nakayama responded to a "newspaper advertisement for a salesman position at a jukebox leasing company" (V&V Hifi Trading Company, which imported Wurlitzer jukeboxes). So he may have started as a salesman rather than strictly a repair technician, though the "repair technician" characterization is widely used and may be accurate for his earliest work. The broad claim is acceptable.

**Verdict:** FOOTNOTE NEEDS CORRECTION. Change "March 21, 1932" to "May 21, 1932" in footnote 27.

---

### 15. CSK buyout: 1984, "$38 million", CSK got "20 percent"

**Chapter says:** "The deal valued Sega's Japanese assets at $38 million. CSK took a 20 percent stake."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (Sega), FundingUniverse, Encyclopedia.com, and multiple sources confirm: $38 million purchase price, CSK acquired 20% stake.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 16. Isao Okawa: "$500 million" personal loan, debt forgiveness

**Chapter says:** "Okawa would eventually loan Sega $500 million of his personal fortune and, on his deathbed, forgive the entire debt."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (Isao Okawa), Celebrity Net Worth, RPG Codex, and Sonic Stadium confirm: In summer 1999, Okawa personally loaned Sega $500 million. Before his death on March 16, 2001, he forgave all of Sega's debts to him and donated his personal shares (totaling approximately $695.7 million in Sega and CSK stock).

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 17. Sega of America: established 1986

**Chapter says:** "the eventual establishment of Sega of America as an autonomous subsidiary in 1986."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. FundingUniverse, Wikipedia (History of Sega), and multiple sources confirm 1986.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 18. SG-1000 launch: July 15, 1983

**Chapter says:** "the SG-1000, Sega's first home video game console, released on July 15, 1983."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (SG-1000), Time Extension, and multiple sources confirm July 15, 1983 -- the same day as the Famicom launch.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 19. SG-1000 series sales: "over 1.4 million units" by 1988

**Chapter says:** "the console series, including its Mark III successor, moved over 1.4 million units by 1988."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (SG-1000) states the SG-1000 console series (including the Mark III) sold over 1.4 million units in Japan as of 1988. Note: this figure is for Japan only and includes the Mark III but apparently not the Master System (which was the Mark III rebranded for Western markets and sold many more units internationally).

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

### 20. Pachinko revenue: "over one trillion yen annually by 1970"

**Chapter says:** "pachinko, whose parlors generated over one trillion yen annually by 1970."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (Pachinko) and the Japan-tech-culture research document both confirm approximately one trillion yen ($2.8 billion) annually by 1970.

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

## Additional Verifications

### Income Doubling Plan: "announced in 1960"

**Chapter body says:** "Prime Minister Ikeda's Income Doubling Plan, announced in 1960."

**Chapter footnote 15 says:** "announced in December 1960."

**Verification:** The cabinet formally adopted the plan on December 27, 1960. The plan had been publicly discussed since fall 1960. The chapter body saying "announced in 1960" is acceptable shorthand. The footnote correctly specifies "December 1960."

**Verdict:** ACCURATE as written. No correction needed.

---

### David Rosen death date (context, not in chapter body)

**Research says:** Died December 25, 2025, at age 95.

**Verification:** CONFIRMED by Time Extension, PC Gamer, Game Developer, SEGAbits, and multiple obituaries published January 2026.

**Verdict:** Confirmed for reference. Not in chapter body, only in footnote 12, which is correct.

---

### Rosen's military branch

**Chapter says:** "served in the United States Air Force."

**Verification:** CONFIRMED. Wikipedia (David Rosen) and multiple obituaries confirm United States Air Force service (1948-1952).

**Verdict:** ACCURATE. No correction needed.

---

## Corrections Required

### CORRECTION 1: Slot machine ban date (1952 -> 1951)

**Location:** Chapter body (line 27) and footnote 6 (line 167).

**Current text (body):** "Then, in 1952, the United States government did something..."

**Corrected text (body):** "Then, in 1951, the United States government did something..."

**Current text (footnote):** "The U.S. government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1952"

**Corrected text (footnote):** "The Johnson Act (Transportation of Gambling Devices Act), enacted January 2, 1951, prohibited the transportation of gambling devices to U.S. territories and possessions"

---

### CORRECTION 2: "Sole controlling owner" contradiction

**Location:** Chapter body (line 65).

**Current text:** "In 1969, Rosen -- by then the sole controlling owner of Sega -- sold the company to Gulf and Western Industries"

**Corrected text:** "In 1969, Sega was sold to Gulf and Western Industries"

**Rationale:** The chapter goes on two lines later to say "The price was $10 million for the 80 percent stake held by Bromley and Stewart," which contradicts Rosen being "sole controlling owner." The phrase comes from some Wikipedia sources but is inconsistent with the share ownership details. Removing it eliminates the contradiction while preserving the narrative.

---

### CORRECTION 3: Nakayama birth date in footnote

**Location:** Footnote 27 (line 209).

**Current text:** "Hayao Nakayama (born March 21, 1932)"

**Corrected text:** "Hayao Nakayama (born May 21, 1932)"

---

## Notes (No Correction Required)

### Periscope authorship dispute

The chapter says Periscope was Sega's "first original game" (1966). This is the standard account in mainstream Sega histories. However, Namco's Masaya Nakamura claimed to have built a similar game called "Torpedo Launcher" in 1965. The exact relationship between the two games is disputed among historians. The chapter's claim reflects the accepted mainstream narrative and does not require correction, but this is worth noting for scholarly rigor.

### 25-cent play timing

The chapter says Periscope "prompted operators to raise the standard price of play from ten cents to twenty-five cents." More precisely, the 25-cent pricing was associated with Sega's 1968 single-player export redesign, not the 1966 original. The chapter does not specify which version introduced the price change, so it is not technically wrong, but the implication that it happened in 1966 rather than 1968 is slightly misleading. No correction applied as the chapter does not claim a specific date for the pricing change.

### Revenue figure precision

The $10 million price for the Gulf and Western sale: the They Create Worlds blog, citing primary documents, gives the exact figure as $9,977,043. The chapter's "$10 million" is a standard rounding used in virtually all published accounts.
